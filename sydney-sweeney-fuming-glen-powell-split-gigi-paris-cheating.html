href=#>&nbsp;movie</a>, Anyone But You, in&nbsp;<a href=#>Australia</a>, and photographs of them together show Sydney hugging Glen.</p><p>The 34-year-old actor had been dating model&nbsp;<a href=#>Gigi Paris</a>, 30,&nbsp;since 2020, but the couple have now reportedly split.&nbsp;</p><p>Gigi&nbsp;<a href=#>unfollowed the actor on Instagram</a>&nbsp;and posted a video of herself with a cryptic message this week which read: "Know your worth & onto the next".</p><p>Sydney, 25, has been engaged&nbsp;to her longtime boyfriend,&nbsp;<a href=#>Chicago</a>-based restauranteur&nbsp;Jonathan Davino,&nbsp;since February 2022.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Sydney Sweeney">Sydney Sweeney</h2><p>The couple started dating in 2018.</p><p>Speculation has been rife online that her chemistry with Glen may have contributed to <a href=#>his breakup</a>, but she has been telling friends they have not crossed the line.</p><h2>DATING RUMORS</h2><p>An LA-based friend of the star exclusively told The U.S. Sun: "Sydney is getting dragged into Glen Powell's drama by no choice of her own.</p><p>"She says she has kept things strictly professional with Glen during their short time knowing each other and generally, her M.O. is to not mix her dating life with her work.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"This is a very disciplined, serious young woman who is trying to settle down and get a family going with <a href=#>Jonathan Davino</a> in the next few years.</p><p>"Despite the characters she plays, she isn't a 'party girl' and she sure as hell isn't a home-wrecker.</p><p>"She doesn't want or need this attention and, to be frank, this is Glen's problem for letting his relationship with Gigi get out of control and for being so public about his personal life on social media."</p><p>TMZ previously claimed Sydney is still engaged, with photographs showing her fiance walking her dog Tank this week near their home.</p><p>The source went on to add that the movie Sydney and Glen have been working on was only shooting in Australia for around 40 days, and this is a "temporary situation" which has spun out into a "mini-scandal" and is her "worst nightmare."</p><p>"If she and Glen were closer, she'd tell him to handle his problems privately instead of letting them bleed into social media," the pal added to The U.S. Sun.</p><h2>CO-STAR SPLIT</h2><p>"But the fact is, she and Glen don't have much of a personal relationship at all beyond the making of this movie.</p><p>"Glen's real-life girlfriend problems are now infecting how people will perceive this project before they've even had the chance to market it.</p><p>"It's distracting and annoying as hell and Sydney loathes that she's been publicly dragged into this."</p><p>The U.S. Sun has reached out to Sweeney's rep for comment.</p><p>Since Gigi unfollowed her boyfriend on Instagram, a source <a href=#>told PEOPLE</a> the pair split weeks ago, citing Glen's busy schedule as the main issue.</p><p>The insider said they had been on the rocks ever since the release of <a href=#>Top Gun: Maverick</a>, which came out in May last year.</p><p>The source added: "Gigi was never happy with the long-distance filming and when she came to Australia they both decided to break up for good."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>In February 2023, Sydney told<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>&nbsp;Cosmopolitan&nbsp;</a>that she does not date people in the&nbsp;<a href=#>entertainment&nbsp;</a>industry.</p><p>"I don't date actors or musicians or anyone in entertainment because I can just be normal Syd that way and it's easiest," she told the outlet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
