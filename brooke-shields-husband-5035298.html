He got his start writing for TV back in the 90s. His earliest work included writing a few episodes of shows like Campus Cops, Spin City, The Army Show, and a few award shows like the 1997 Emmy Awards and 2002 Oscars, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Brooke-Shields-Husband-5-Things-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The model</a> first met the TV writer back in 1999. In an excerpt from her 2005 memoir Down Came The Rain,&nbsp;she revealed that they first met when she brought her pet bulldog Darla to meet friends at the Warner Brothers lot gym, and when the pup wandered off, her future husband was the one who brought her back, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Today</a>. “He was writing for a show filmed on the lot and loved dogs. We chatted and he made me laugh,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Brooke and Chris ended up tying the knot two years later in a romantic ceremony off the coast of Catalina, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Post</a>. It was a small ceremony with family and friends on a boat, and over 20 years later, the couple are still going very strong.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Brooke and Chris are also loving parents to two daughters. They had their first child, <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rowan Francis,</a></strong> in 2003, and their second,&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Grier Hammond,</a></strong>&nbsp;in 2006. Brooke has been open about<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> her struggles</a> with postpartum depression after welcoming Rowan in her memoir. Now that the girls are growing up, Brooke has also spoken about how her parenting style differs from Chris’ in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Good Housekeeping</a><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>.</a> “It’s not in his nature to be judgmental. He’s so forgiving. That’s great for our marriage, but not great for parenting. With kids, that gets you trampled on,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Brooke-Shields-Husband-5-Things-SS-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Besides being a writer, Chris has delved into a number of different aspects of the film and TV worlds, including dabbling a little in acting. He’s made small appearances in TV shows like&nbsp;Entourage&nbsp;and movies like&nbsp;Daddy’s Home&nbsp;and&nbsp;Step Brothers.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Despite some small roles, most of Chris’ work has been behind the camera. He’s been a producer on a bunch of different comedy movies, including&nbsp;Get Hard, The Boss,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Daddy’s Home. He’s also been an executive producer for a bunch of different projects like&nbsp;Eastbound and Down&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Campaign.&nbsp;He also dabbled in directing in the hit film&nbsp;Impractical Jokers: The Movie,&nbsp;which he also produced.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>While Brooke and Chris have been married for over two decades, he’s actually<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> the model’</a>s second husband. Before the pair met, Brooke had been married to pro tennis player&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Andre Agassi</a>&nbsp;</strong>from 1997 to 1999.
