Mischa Barton posed for a risqué topless Instagram pic during her Greece vacation on Tuesday, July 12.
In the photo, the O.C. alum, 30, wears nothing but jeans and smokes a cigarette as she perches on a balcony overlooking the water and the cliffside city of Mykonos. “Island vibes #Mykonos #Censored,” she captioned it. The former Dancing With the Stars contestant even did some editing on her vacay snap and blurred out her nipples in accordance with Instagram’s nudity policy."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

On Monday, July 11, she shared a <a href=#>snap&nbsp;</a>of herself in bed wearing a chambray shirt completely unbuttoned. “Morning vibes !!! Monday lets do this,” she wrote.</p><p>She also raised eyebrows on July 7 when she <a href=#>shared a long Instagram tribute to <b>Alton Sterling</b></a>, who was killed by police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on July 5. Her caption was well intentioned, but she accompanied the text with a photo of herself looking somber in a black bikini as she held a glass of rosé on a yacht.</p><p>“I’m truly heartbroken to watch videos like the #altonsterling execution. This may have been going on forever in the United States but thank god the pigs get caught on camera now,” she wrote in the since-deleted post. “Its unthinkable and an embarrassment to America. The country I was brought up in. Somebody make change. We need gun control and unity. And a real President so think about that when this election is around the corner. The world is a precarious place right now #stop #reflect and #act appropriately.”</p><p>Her Instagram followers immediately expressed their outrage with her photo choice. “Like the sentiment, but hard to take you seriously while you post a picture of you sipping alcohol on a yacht,” one commenter wrote.</p><p>The actress later tweeted an apology: “I’m human I’m not perfect and I’m sorry if my Instagram post went out of context I didn’t mean to offend anyone.” She also posted three more appropriate photos to memorialize Sterling, including one of his family and a quote by <b>Malcolm X</b>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGamoaOYtaJ5wZqpraeeYrCmutKoqaxlmJq%2FbrvWp2Stp6ChsrS%2FjKmgnGWnZ35zhY9qZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
