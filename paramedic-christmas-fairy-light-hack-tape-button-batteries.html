Twinkly fairy lights can really bring your tree and home to life - but a team of paediatric nurses warned parents that some varieties could be dangerous to their little ones. Battery operated Christmas bulbs can be particularly hazardous, as many of them contain toxic button batteries. These little coin-sized batteries can cause life-threatening injuries if swallowed and pose a danger to curious toddlers who might open the battery case when rooting around the tree."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Comb the house for button batteries</h2><p>On top of Christmas lights, the <a aria-label="British Association of Paediatric Surgeons (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British Association of Paediatric Surgeons</a> urged parents to comb through gadgets or toys that might also contain dangerous button batteries.</p><p>Your little ones will be spending much more time at home over the holidays, so there's more opportunity for them to pick up the batteries in items you might have forgotten about.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a aria-label="Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children</a> warned that the batteries can also be found in greetings cards that make a sound, so keep these out of reach if received in your home.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Safety check your lights</h2><p>You should always check whether any of the little bulbs on the lights have fallen off - they're small enough to present a choking hazard to curious tots who put them in their mouth.</p><p>But&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">St John Ambulance</a>&nbsp;Medical Director, Lynn Thomas, also advised that you inspect the cables for any damage or fraying.</p><p>Don't use the lights if you notice either of those things. Instead, you should dispose of the lights safely.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Beware of toxic decorations</h2><p><a href=# aria-label="Nemours Kids Health (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nemours Kids Health</a> also warned that other decorations you adorn your house with might be toxic to your little ones.</p><p>Plants like mistletoe, holly, Jerusalem cherry, and amaryllis are <a href=#>toxic if eaten</a>, the child safety experts said.</p><p>And while snow sprays might add a frosty touch to your festive displays, they can be hazardous if the powder is swallowed or the aerosol is sprayed into the eyes or on the skin.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4.
