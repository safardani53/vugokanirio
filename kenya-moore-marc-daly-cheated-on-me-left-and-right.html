"He had no problem with that."</p><p>The source then accuses: "and no problem disrespecting her."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Just weeks ago, on September 19, Kenya announced that her marriage is over already.</p><p>"It is with profound sadness that I regret to inform my fans that I am divorcing my husband, Marc Daly,” Kenya began.</p><p>Her statement went out of its way to be vague.</p><p>“Due to recent and ongoing circumstances," she explained. "I can no longer continue in the marriage."</p><p>That could be anything and everything, and she knew it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"My sole concern and focus is and will always be my daughter, Brooklyn," Kenya correctly added.</p><p>Once you create a person, you owe them everything. The best of your attention, your patience, your love, and your time.</p><p>She goes on to refer to Brooklyn as "my miracle baby."</p><p>Notably, Kenya gave birth to Brooklyn past the age at which doctors generally recommend a pregnancy.</p><p>Kenya affirmed: "She was made in love and true commitment."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Clearly, that last line was a reference to Marc’s cheating, possibly intended to point fans in that direction without saying anything directly.</p><p>Finally, Kenya concluded: "I ask for our privacy to be respected moving forward."</p><p>Not to be all that’s what they all say, but generally, most statements aboud divorce, separation, breaking up, or a family death end with that line.</p><p>Up to a point, it’s a very reasonable request, but they know that fans will be curious.</p><p>And, of course, reality stars and other celebrities know that their cultural relevance is largely contingent upon fans keeping up with their lives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It’s obviously hugely disappointing to hear that Marc is allegedly a no good cheater.</p><p>One, that’s hugely unfair to Kenya, a human being with feelings. It’s also unfair to Brooklyn, though she doesn’t know that yet.</p><p>But as you may recall, Marc was aggressively camera-shy, to the point where they had a secret wedding that almost got Kenya fired on the spot.</p><p>His reason for avoiding The Real Housewives of Atlanta was that he felt that the show portrays black men in a negative light.</p><p>In particular, he resented how black men seemed to be shown to be worse partners in comparison to white men.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>He was absolutely right to say that. People have written entire dissertations on reality shows and this one in particular.</p><p>Reality television rewards bad bheavior in its stars, but has a particularly negative effect upon public perceptions of black stars.</p><p>Eventually, Marc did agree to appear on the show.</p><p>But he can’t blame Bravo’s cameras for his infidelity, now can he?</p><p>Unfortunately, someone can be right about an important issue and still be a garbage person in their private life.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>The Real Housewives of Atlanta Trailer: Tapes, Tears and, Yes, Titties</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pxX2Z9cLfEp7CaZZ2kvLOxjKaYq5tdma6txYycn56ZpJqxbrvNZqSeZZyas7V5wKebZqqZnLW1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
