So she didn‚Äôt love hearing that Marlo kicked her own nephews out of her house and told them to go live with their other aunt for a while. Kenya told this to Sanya privately, but since Sanya is the new bone collector, she ran right to Marlo and told her what Kenya had said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>So before everyone gathered in the cars to go mining for gems, Marlo asked Kenya if she could speak to her privately. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kenya refused</a>, so Marlo chased her around the house. Kenya then asked if they could have their talk in front of the group, but Marlo didn‚Äôt want to do that so nothing was getting resolved. And because Marlo didn‚Äôt want to deal with Kenya‚Äôs drama, she told her to go home. But, of course, Kenya refused, so everyone sat in the driveway for over 90 minutes trying to resolve what was going on.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>All the while, <strong>Drew</strong> <strong>Sidora</strong> was making things worse by starting her own drama with <strong>Sheree Whitfield</strong>‚Äòs friend, <strong>Fatum</strong>. Fatum had previously made accusations about Drew‚Äôs husband, <strong>Ralph</strong> <strong>Pittman</strong>, so Drew said she wouldn‚Äôt ride in the same car as Fatum. She also said that Fatum is basically Sheree‚Äôs lapdog, as she let out some barks.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sneak Peek of Tonight‚Äôs <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#RHOA</a> ‚Äî Marlo gets emotional talking to Sheree & Sanya about her not wanting any drama. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/GCI3KIJKGA</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>‚Äî jay (@JaysRealityBlog) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>July 24, 2022</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>As the Blue Ridge trip continues, Marlo stands firm on the ultimatum she gave to Kenya.

She invited some of the ladies to join her, and eventually, everyone started jumping on the trampoline in the backyard. Afterwards, Marlo decided to put any and all drama to the side so the ladies could enjoy their time in Blue Ride.

Fatum then started yelling at Drew, and told her to sit back down. Drew separated herself from the situation, and Fatum eventually calmed down. But once everyone returned to the house, Marlo broke down in tears. She told Sheree and Sanya that she didn‚Äôt want to deal with the drama anymore.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Then, she called a house meeting and once everyone was gathered together, she told everyone to go home. Marlo told the ladies that she ordered cars for everyone and she wanted them to leave. She said she planned the trip so she could get support from them in her time of need, but everyone was only making her life more stressful. And while no one really agreed with Marlo‚Äôs decision, they respected it and started packing their bags. But not before Drew threw a dog bone at Fatum for being Sheree‚Äôs lap dog and causing a lot of the drama on the trip.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Want more drama?
