Click here to see pics from Taylor Swift’s new music video!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>As we previously told you, Taylor’s best friend, <strong>Abigail Anderson</strong>, will be getting married on Sept. 2, and Taylor has been invited — heck, she may even serve as a bridesmaid.&nbsp;Taylor and Abigail have been BFFs since they were teenagers, and have gone&nbsp;through just about everything&nbsp;together, including high school breakups and attending the&nbsp;Grammy&nbsp;Awards together, so we’re not surprised to learn Taylor’s attending Abigail’s nuptials. We just hope Joe can manage to take a break from filming his new movie, Mary Queen of Scots, so he can attend the wedding with Tay-Tay. Wouldn’t that be so sweet?</p>Not only would Taylor have the chance to celebrate her BFF’s big day with her boyfriend, but she and Joe could also celebrate the massive success of her new song, “Look What You Made Me Do.” The video for the song, which dropped at the <a href=#>MTV Video Music Awards</a> on Aug. 27, recently broke streaming records. In less than 24 hours, the video racked up more nearly 37 million views at press time, making it the most-viewed music video in that timeframe so far this year. The lyric video also broke some records after its release on Aug. 24. It’s definitely a good time to be Taylor Swift!<p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, are YOU a fan of Taylor and Joe as a couple?
