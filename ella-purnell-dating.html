Meet her boyfriend, Max Bennett Kelly.</h2><p>The Yellowjackets star isn’t shy about sharing her love for her boyfriend, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Max Bennett Kelly</a>, on social media.</p><p>Ella and Max have been together since at least March 2022, with the 26-year-old actress sharing her first post with the singer on Instagram at the time. “Max Bennett Kelly appreciation post,” the Sweetbitter star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> alongside a film camera photo of the duo.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Ella’s boyfriend, Max, is also in the entertainment industry. The singer has released <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">several songs</a> since 2020, from “Tukwila Soda Lime” and “So Far Gone” to “Happy, Healthy, Well-Adjusted” and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“Broke.”</a></p><p>On Max’s birthday, Ella shared an adorable photo of her and the musician kissing on Instagram. “Happy Birthday to my love,” The Army of the Dead actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>. “You are the best thing to ever [happen] to me.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ella Purnell recently addressed rumors that she was dating Brad Pitt.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In 2017, The Daily Mail falsely reported that Ella was dating <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a>. The Yellowjackets star was only 21, while the Fight Club actor was 53.
