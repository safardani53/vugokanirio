Nevertheless, Micah is now here and is ready to claim a spot in the Pep Guardiola’s City side.</p><h2>Is Micah Hamilton Related To Lewis Hamilton?</h2><p>The City striker Micah Hamilton has no relation with the F1 legend Lewis Hamilton. A Manchester City Academy product, Micah has entered the limelight after scoring for City against Red Star Belgrade.&nbsp;</p><p>The youngster hasn’t appeared for many interviews, but after his exploits against Belgrade, that might change soon. On his Instagram handle, Hamilton has only shared pictures from training and his time playing with the academy.</p><p>He hasn’t shared much about his personal life on the public platform. The only personal pictures are from his trip to Dubai last year and a few snaps from a party.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/micah-hamilton-family.jpg><p>A religious athlete, Micah’s Instagram bio has the line, 1% Chance and 99% Faith.
