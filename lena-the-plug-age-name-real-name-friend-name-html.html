She had&nbsp;never revealed her actual name in any of her main accounts, increasing her fan's curiosity to know her real name. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But that changed in October 2019, as she revealed her given name,&nbsp;Lena Nersesian, through her Instagram bio.</p><p></p><p><strong>A snippet of Lena The Plug's pregnancy account, Lena The Mom,&nbsp;reveals her real name.</strong><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> (Photo: Lena The Mom/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Her Age and Birthday</h2><p>Lena was born on&nbsp;June 1, 1991, in&nbsp;California, United States.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Interestingly, her&nbsp;boyfriend Adam usually wishes her birthday one day prior because he wants to be the first one to wish Lena.</p><p>On May 31, 2019, when the same thing happened, many of her fans asked her on Twitter&nbsp;if her husband doesn't know her real birth date. In reply, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>, "He knows my real bday you guys, he just wanted to be first." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In 2020, Adam <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wished</a> Lena through Instagram,&nbsp;writing, "Happy birthday to the love of my life."</p><p>This year, the social media star <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">took</a> to her Instagram to share her pre-birthday looks for her 30th birthday celebration.

And since then,&nbsp;the two have appeared on each other's YouTube channels on vlogs and other content on social media. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Lena even <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a> that she lets her best friend&nbsp;Rinaudo&nbsp;into the bedroom with her and her boyfriend Adam.
