The following year, when she was just 15 years old, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Karl Lagerfeld</a> hired her to be one of the faces of Chanel. She has appeared in a number of French films, and is set to star as a pop star in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>HBO's upcoming series The Idol</a> alongside <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>The Weeknd</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lily-Rose has also made headlines for her love life. She's most <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>recently been linked</a> to French rapper Yassine Stein. She <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>previously dated</a> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Timothée Chalamet</a> for about a year and was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>spotted sharing a steamy kiss</a> with her Yoga Hosers costar <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>Austin Butler</a> after a dinner date in August 2021.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2015, Depp <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>praised his daughter</a> after she joined the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Self Evident Project</a>, which celebrates individuals who don't define themselves as "100 percent straight."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She's got thousands of followers on social media, and they were all taken completely by surprise," Depp told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Daily Mail</a>. "But not me. I already knew because she tells me everything — she's not afraid to say anything to me. We're super-tight and I'm very proud of our relationship."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Lily's really together — she's a sharp kid and one of the smartest human beings I have ever met," he continued. "Whatever she is doing, if she needs any advice, I'm there for her. Kids are going to make their own decisions, but I guess that the only thing you can do as a parent is to offer support. And I do."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lily-Rose <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>came to her father's defense</a> in 2016 after Heard first accused the actor of abuse. Next to a since-deleted photo of her and Depp on Instagram, she wrote, "My dad is the sweetest, most loving person I know, he's been nothing but a wonderful father to my little brother and I, and everyone who knows him would say the same."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In November 2022, Lily-Rose <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told ELLE</a> why she doesn't feel obligated to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>comment on her dad's defamation trial</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When it's something that's so private and so personal that all of a sudden becomes not so personal … I feel really entitled to my secret garden of thoughts," she said. "I also think that I'm not here to answer for anybody, and I feel like for a lot of my career, people have really wanted to define me by the men in my life, whether that's my family members or my boyfriends, whatever. And I'm really ready to be defined for the things that I put out there."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lily-Rose also opened up about how her parents "protected" her and Jack from the spotlight "as much as possible" while they were kids.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I know my childhood didn't look like everybody's childhood, and it's a very particular thing to deal with, but it's also the only thing that I know," she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In May 2023, during an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>W Magazine</a>, Lily-Rose described shooting a live scene for The Idol at one of The Weeknd's sold-out concerts in Los Angeles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was a nervous wreck," she said about performing in front of 70,000 people. "I was praying to all my guardian angels. I knew we only had two takes at SoFi [Stadium]. I felt like I was going to my wedding—I was so dolled up and in white!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lily-Rose went on to admit that she "never thought" she'd land the part of Jocelyn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I knew there would be many lovely ladies who are more musical than me, but I thought, I'll give it a go," she said. "I wanted to wear pop-star colors. And I wanted to channel a certain L.A. feeling. I grew up in L.A., and I'm an L.A. girl, and so is Jocelyn. I wanted to capture the style mix of mischief and shine."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later that month, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lily-Rose showed support for her dad</a> after the premiere of his biographical drama&nbsp;Jeanne du Barry at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm super happy for him.

Unlike Lily-Rose, Jack has stayed out of the spotlight and is rarely photographed. Paradis previously opened up about her desire to give her kids the option to live out of the public eye, telling <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Weekend Knack magazine</a> in 2007, "Now I indeed keep them away from the cameras, because I don't want our children to be forced to share in our fame against their will. They didn't ask for that. Not yet. The day that they will decide for themselves to do things that might bring them into the spotlights, then I won't stop them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jack is quite close with his older sister, who <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>revealed in Interview magazine</a> that when she and Jack were in school in the United States, they'd often speak to one another in French. "When my brother and I were at the same school, whenever we wanted to say something that was going to stay just between us, we could say it in French and nobody would understand," Lily-Rose said, adding that they always spoke French at home with Paradis.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lily-Rose celebrated her brother's 18th birthday in August 2020 with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>sweet tribute</a> on Instagram. "My little baby Jackie is 18🥺My baby bro my heart and soul happy birthday I love you SO MUCH!" she wrote alongside a snap of the duo from when they were kids.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Lily Rose Depp Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Depp doesn't discuss his children publicly often, but has said he's proud of Jack's artistry. "My boy Jack ... draws really super well. He also plays music very well. He's got a good feel for that," he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>told The Philippine Daily Inquirer</a> in 2014. "Aside from school plays and things, he hasn't shown any desire to become an actor. Whew!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2018, Depp <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Rolling Stone</a> that one of the proudest moments of his life was when Jack announced he'd started a band and shared the group's name with Depp.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The kid says 'Clown Boner,' " Depp told the publication. "We don't need a paternity test. That's my kid."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jack tends to keep his personal life private, though he was previously <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>linked to model Camille Jansen</a> in August 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CWv6a606xmmqScYq6ju9StZKOnmKO7unnDnqepZZuesbR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
