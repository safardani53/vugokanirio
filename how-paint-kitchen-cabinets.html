Start by removing the doors</h3><p>The first step is simply to take the doors off the cabinets to prevent drips and further mess.</p><p>You don't want your <a href=#>hard work looking worse</a> than before you started.</p><p>Most will be easy to remove by unclipping the hinges, which you can then cover with masking tape so they don't get splattered at all.</p><p>You can skip this step if you want, just remember to paint a thin layer, and protect the walls and floor around it.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><h3 id=2-remove-all-handles>2.

Clean the doors</h3><p>This might feel tedious but a clean work surface is crucial to making your kitchen look brand new.</p><p><a href=#>Paint will cling to dirt</a> instead of the door itself, causing peeling and chipping on your freshly decorated cabinets, which is the last thing you want.</p><h3 id=4-sand-down-the-surface>4. Sand down the surface</h3><p>Even surfaces are the goal here and sanding down doors will help reduce any scratches or chips.</p><p>A light sand should be enough, 150-250 grit will do it.</p><p>Afterwards, make sure you wipe the dust off with a damp cloth and leave it to dry out.</p><h3 id=5-begin-painting>5. Begin painting</h3><p>Use your brush to paint an even layer across the whole door, getting into all the nooks as you go.</p><p>Allow each layer to dry the recommended amount and apply again until you have the desired effect.</p><p>You can complete the centre of the door with a roller if you have one to give it a professional appearance.</p><h3 id=6-let-it-dry-and-reassmble>6.
