I hope you guys come join us!”</p><p>Gellar’s <a href=#>role in Wolf Pack marks her return to television</a> after previously starring in hit shows including <a href=#>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>, Ringer and The Crazy Ones. She has also appeared in <a href=#>I Know What You Did Last Summer</a>, the <a href=#>Scooby Doo</a> film franchise, <a href=#>Cruel Intentions</a> and Southland Tales.</p><p>In the upcoming series, Gellar plays an arson investigator Kristin Ramsey who gets caught up in the supernatural activities around her. According to Paramount+, the character is “a highly regarded expert in her field and no stranger to personal loss, brought in by authorities to catch the teenage arsonist who started a massive wildfire which may have also led to the reawakening of a supernatural predator terrorizing Los Angeles.”</p><p>Along with Wolf Pack, the streaming service <a href=#>is also set to release a Teen Wolf revival movie</a>.
