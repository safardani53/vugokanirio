It has absolutely NOTHING to do with people, it’s just food, FFS! She’s completely floored by it. She’s also super, super upset, as she is the least racist person out there.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hey <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@FoodNetwork</a> – this anti-Asian sentiment being promoted on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@thepioneerwoman</a>'s show really isn't cool. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/dM1cbXcHKc</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>— Thick Dumpling Skin (@dumplingskin) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>March 6, 2017</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Ree is a total sweetheart, and she loves everyone — all colors, creeds and races” the insider added of the Food Network star. “She’s trying to get some perspective by hanging on to the fact that it’s just PC madness gone wild. Like, seriously, people need to get a life if this is what’s upsetting them, and stop creating problems where there truly are none.”</p><h3><a class=pmclinkcontent-post href=# rel=noopener>‘Pioneer Woman’ Cooking Show — PICS</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>The joke that Ree made on her show — which focuses on “downhome” cooking — that has stirred up such controversy involved chicken wings, of all things. Ree pulled out a tray of delicious looking Asian-style wings and laid them before her family, who wanted to know where the “real wings” were, as these did not look appetizing to them. “I’m just kidding guys, I wouldn’t do that to you!” Ree said before going back to the oven to retrieve a tray of American-style wings, much to the delight of the crowd. This bit did not sit right with viewers and has since gone viral.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what do you think Ree had to say about the racism controversy she’s going through due to the joke she made on her cooking show?
