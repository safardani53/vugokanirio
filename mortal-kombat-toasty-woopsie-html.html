Apart from narrating&nbsp;the story of gods and humans fighting an unabating war for the world, the combat series is peppered with tongue-in-cheek&nbsp;phrases intended to bring a smile on&nbsp;the players'&nbsp;faces. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The very popular phrase "Toasty!" is an example of how funny t<span>hings can get inside this game amongst serious bloodshed.</span> What is more intriguing is how this&nbsp;winsome phrase was born out of a whoopsie moment.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>The History Of "Toasty!"</h2><p>Dan Forden, the Mortal Kombat <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sound designer</a>, is&nbsp;the creator of this iconic line.&nbsp;As per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Screenrant</a>, when Dan and his co-worker, Ed Boon, played Super High Impact against one another, he would say, "I predict toast!" in other words, "I predict you'll lose!" <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In due course, the phrase became an in-joke turning into "I predict toasty!"</p><p>Boon recommended that Dan should appear in the game with his trademark taunt. The team found it hilarious, and thus "Toasty!" became a part of Mortal Kombat Legends.&nbsp;</p><h2>When Did Players First See "Toasty!"</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>What started as a joke made its way into the game as an image of Dan <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">appearing</a> in the right bottom corner of the screen shouting "Toasty!" in a falsetto accent whenever a player performed a particularly vicious uppercut.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The "Toasty!" joke soon became a trademark, evolving with every iteration of the iconic video game.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Evolution Of "Toasty!" Over The Years</h2><p>In Mortal Kombat 2, "Toasty"&nbsp;triggered a fight with a secret character. When players used Scorpion's fire-breathing fatality in the game, Forden's taunt set&nbsp;off, but he&nbsp;did&nbsp;not appear in the bottom corner.&nbsp;</p><p>The ''Toasty'' remark was also there in Mortal Kombat 3, but with several new twists on its&nbsp;classic form. When players used Sub-Zero's powers to freeze enemies, Forden occasionally emerged&nbsp;on the bottom corner and taunted, "Frosty!" in the same falsetto as "Toasty!"&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>''Toasty'' next emerged in Mortal Kombat 4, where Dan would say "Toasty 3D!" highlighting that Mortal Kombat 4 was the series' first game to use 3D graphics. In Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, the players are taunted with "Toasty!" on failing a minigame.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Henceforth, the phrase has appeared in some form or other in most of the franchise's games.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>"Toasty!" In The Pop Culture</h2><p>The phrase ''Toasty'' was introduced to the internet in 2011 by the website <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Toasty It</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It allowed the visitors to&nbsp;replicate the "Toasty" easter egg from Mortal Kombat on a website of their choice. Once replicated,&nbsp;Dan embraces the bottom-right corner of the screen, screaming "Toasty!" to make internet surfing more fun. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This quotation also appeared&nbsp;multiple times in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Skrillex</a>'s song '<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Reptile</a>.'&nbsp;The rapper <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">SpaceGhostPurrp </a>also uses the line in his song Been Fweago&nbsp;on many occasions. It also finds a mention&nbsp;in one of the lines of Starbomb's song 'Mortal Kombat High.'&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>It's fair to assume that Dan and the "Toasty!" taunt will continue to feature in Mortal Kombat games in the future; the only question is - how will the easter eggs evolve? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinqKhdmMKtwNSrnGiln6fBoriMpKammpGperW7wKyrsmWnpLyxv8ieZaGsnaE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
