She is well-known for her frequent meteorological appearances on CTV News. She is well-known for presenting podcasts in addition to being a weather forecaster. The television personality has achieved immense renown in her almost ten-year career.</p><p>Aside from her work life, her followers all around the globe are curious about her personal life. In terms of her personal life, the Canadian weather forecaster is a mother. Her spouse, Nick Oakes, is the love of her life. But who exactly is Nick Oakes? In today’s brief segment, get to meet Bradlyn Oakes’ spouse.</p><h2>Bradlyn Oakes’s Husband</h2><p>Bradlyn and Nick Oakes are happily married. The adoring couple married in January 2019. The Oakes have been together since then. They have yet to have a child. In front of their parents and relatives, the gorgeous couple went down the aisle. The couple’s common love of mountains and travel has also played an important part in their marriage.</p><p>The Oakes’ wedding images were taken in Banff, Alberta. Their photograph is stunning. The bride and groom are standing on a snowy mountain, laughing and enjoying the breeze – it’s great. The meteorologist’s spouse seems to be a fireman. However, it is unknown if Nick is still employed or has moved on.&nbsp;Furthermore, Bradlyn and her spouse don’t seem to forget to wish each other on significant occasions. They also travel regularly and have made several memories together. We wish the wonderful couple an eternal relationship filled with unending love and support.&nbsp;The CTV News official presented herself as a travel enthusiast in one of her blog articles.&nbsp;She claims that her time in Sydney taught her that she is not a city girl. “In the middle of nowhere, with a camera in hand and my backpack on, I feel more myself.” “I need fresh air and exploration,” the weather forecaster stated.</p><h2>Bradlyn Oakes is departing from CTV Regina.</h2><p>Bradlyn Oakes of CTV Regina stated yesterday that she will be leaving her employment to explore her next adventure. She started studying radio in high school in Sherwood Park. The travel blogger was attempting to create a profession out of acting, math, and her passion for the weather. Twister, a 1996 film, had a big effect on her determination to explore the weather.</p><p>After receiving her bachelor’s degree in Earth and Atmospheric Science and throwing all she had into a backpack, the TV personality chose to tour the globe. She immediately relocated to Sydney, Australia, where she earned a master’s degree in media production.&nbsp;Oakes began her radio career as a morning broadcaster in Sydney, Australia, where she covered news, weather, and current affairs.&nbsp;After returning to Canada, she resumed her broadcast career as the CBC North meteorologist. The weather anchor joined CTV News after working for CBC North for over a year.</p><h2>Bradlyn Oakes Net Worth</h2><p>Bradlyn Oakes began working at CTV News in January 2021. She has been predicting, producing, and presenting weather reports since then. A broadcast meteorologist at CTV News makes between C$62K and C$156K per year, according to Payscale. As a result, Oakes must also fall within that range. Bradlyn’s other pursuits as a travel blogger, novelist, and podcast presenter must undoubtedly contribute considerably to her riches.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuusicomankaCytHnBq5idpKmjerCtyp6qZqClqK%2BiusNmnZqlmaHGbq3NnWSnnaRixLC%2B06FknZ2klratv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
