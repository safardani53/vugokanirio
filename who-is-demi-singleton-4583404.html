But Will doesn’t dominate the film alone: he’s joined on the big screen by teen actors <strong>Demi Singleton</strong>, 14, and <strong>Saniyya Sidney</strong>, 15, who play Serena and Venus, respectively. While Saniyya has been acting for some years now, Demi is newer to the industry. Below, everything you need to know about King Richard‘s breakout star,&nbsp;Demi Singleton.</p><h2><strong>1. <strong>Demi is from New Orleans.</strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Demi-Singleton-serena-williams-King-Richard-shutter-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Demi was born on February 27, 2007, and is from New Orleans, New Orleans, according to her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb page</a>. However, she didn’t stick around in the Big Easy for long. At the age of 3, Demi moved to New York City to pursue her talents in dance, acting and singing. She studied at a music conservatory for children in Brooklyn, where she expanded her talents by learning how to play instruments.</p><h2><strong>2. <strong>She was on Broadway.</strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Demi-Singleton-serena-williams-King-Richard-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Demi’s career on Broadway began when she was 10 years old. Per her IMDb, Demi was cast in <strong>Andrew Lloyd Webber</strong>‘s School of Rock- The Musical, based on the 2003 comedy film that stars <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jack Black</strong></a>. She was on the production for a full year, after which she joined&nbsp;The Lion King on Broadway as Young Nala. She eventually left&nbsp;The Lion King&nbsp;for a role on television.</p><h2><strong>3. She’s on the show ‘Godfather of Harlem’<strong>.</strong></strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Demi began starring in the Epix crime drama series Godfather of Harlem when the show premiered in September 2019. Demi plays Margaret Johnson, the granddaughter of <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Forest Whitaker</strong></a>‘s Bumpy Johnson, a 1960s New York City gangster. The show has aired two seasons, both consisting of 10 episodes, and Demi has appeared in almost every single episode. <strong>Luis Guzman</strong>, <strong>Nigel Thatch</strong>, <strong>Ilfenesh Hadera</strong>, <strong>Rafi Gavron</strong>, <strong>Lucy Fry</strong>, and more also star in the series.</p><h2><strong><span><span><i>4. </i></span></span><strong><span><span><i>‘King Richard’ is her breakout role.</i></span></span></strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Demi-Singleton-serena-williams-King-Richard-everett-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>There’s no question that&nbsp;King Richard&nbsp;is a pivotal moment for Demi’s career. Before the biopic, Demi’s only big-screen role was in the 2019 film&nbsp;Goldie, though she wasn’t one of the leading stars. Her career is bound to boom from this — and she already has an idea of the projects she’d like to take on next. “Specifically stories with a Black team, Black writer, Black director,” she told&nbsp;<i><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>W Magazine</a>.</i> “I think Black people and&nbsp;people of color in general need a chance to shine and have their moment in this industry.”</p><h2><strong>5. <strong>She still remembers the moment she met Serena Williams.</strong></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Demi-Singleton-serena-williams-King-Richard-shutter-embed-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Demi met Serena, 40, just once during the film, and it was a moment she’ll never forget. “I was shaking!” Demi told W Magazine.&nbsp;“<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Olympia</strong></a> [Serena’s daughter] was there too, too, and we were signing ‘Baby Shark’ to her. We realized there was nothing to be nervous about. Venus and Serena are so kind and loving people. I only really knew them from the court, and when they’re on the court they do not come to play and are seriously in their zone. But that’s now how they are off the court.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2KxprnIZqqippehsrW7zWZrbnBjaX11ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
