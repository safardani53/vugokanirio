Still, Spielberg's adaptation scored 11 Academy Award nominations and five Golden Globe nods (including a win for Goldberg) when it first debuted.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since then, the coming-of-age drama has seen several iterations on Broadway. The Color Purple play debuted at the Broadway Theatre in N.Y.C. in 2005 and starred <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>LaChanze</a>, Felicia P. Fields, Kingsley Leggs, Elisabeth Withers-Mendes, Brandon Victor Dixon, Renée Elise Goldsberry, Krisha Marcano and more. The show, which ran until 2008, scored LaChanze a best actress in a musical Tony for her powerful performance as Celie. Another critically acclaimed revival came in 2015.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, nearly 40 years after the original, The Color Purple is once again hitting the big screen in an adaptation directed by Ghanaian filmmaker Blitz Bazawule, who previously directed The Burial of Kojo (2018) and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Beyoncé</a>'s Black Is King (2020).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As we gear up for the Dec. 25 premiere of the film, here's a look at some of the actors who've played the same character in The Color Purple from the original movie, the 2015 Broadway revival and now, the new film.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-oprah-winfrey--danielle-brooks-as-sofia></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Oprah Winfrey & Danielle Brooks as Sofia</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Oprah, Danielle Brooks.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Warner Brothers/Getty; Walter McBride/WireImage; Warner Bros.

Though she got major praise for her portrayal of Sofia, years of rejection in Hollywood continued to gnaw at her even as she found success. But channeling the character helped her break through.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was on the stage, doing my thing and God blessed me with a Tony nomination and I was terrified ... and so I got imposter syndrome," she revealed while at the Black Excellence Brunch in Los Angeles on Dec. 3. "I was like, 'I can't do this.' But it was [The Color Purple's]&nbsp;story, it was the music and getting to sing 'Hell No' every night. Getting to say 'hell no,' to my fears, 'hell no' to [thinking] I'm not enough.
