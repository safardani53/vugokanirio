Walker as love interest Jack.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is ‘The 27-Hour Day’ about?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>In the movie, Lauren is a wellness expert who peddles the idea of “The 27-Hour Day,” helping her devotees make their daily lives more efficient. That is, until, she gets a reality check…</p><p>“When an important meeting with her business idol goes awry, Lauren realizes she may need to step away to get some perspective,” Hallmark teases in a press release.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>So Lauren, for whom R&R is a foreign concept, agrees to stay at a mountain retreat where electronic devices are verboten, and that’s where she meets Jack, the owner of the retreat.</p><p>“Over the course of the week in the calm setting of the Montana mountains, Lauren realizes she needs to reprioritize what’s important in her life as she finds herself beginning to fall for Jack — and wonders how life will be once she returns to New York and if Jack will follow,” Hallmark adds.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is in the TV movie’s cast?</h2><p>You might know Autumn from her starring roles on the TV shows <a href=#>The O.C.</a>, No Ordinary Family, and Last Resort, or from her recurring roles in <a href=#>Entourage</a>, <a href=#>Hawaii Five-0</a>, and The Arrangement.

According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Agassiz-Harrison Observer</a>, the same area hosted the productions of the TV shows Wayward Pines and <a href=#>Virgin River</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In fact, set dressers for The 27-Hour Day transformed the Agassiz-Harrison Observer office into a veterinary practice, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BC Local News</a>. They made a department store into a hardware supplier and a deli into a cheese shop, and they set up a farmer’s market along Agassiz’s Pioneer Avenue and a honey-themed festival in a local park.
