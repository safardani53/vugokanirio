According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good to Know</a>, Diana and Charles both stood at around 5'10”. Although Diana's height proved that she was a few inches taller than an average woman living in the United Kingdom, she still wasn’t taller than Charles.</p><p>In several staged photos of Charles and Diana together, they were posed in ways to make Charles appear taller than her. It’s easy to notice this type of detail in their wedding photos and their engagement pictures. Diana and Charles's matching height had nothing to do with the fact that their relationship was quite tumultuous, though.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Express,</a> they were both dissatisfied with their relationship and sought out extramarital affairs throughout their 15-year marriage. They separated in 1992 and finalized their divorce in 1996. They had two sons before everything fell apart. And, interestingly enough, their sons ended up growing to be much taller than both of them. <a href=#>Prince William</a> is around 6'2” and <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> is around 6'1”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How tall is Elizabeth Debicki compared to Princess Diana?</h2><p>As mentioned before, Diana stood at around 5‘10". <a href=#>Elizabeth Debicki</a> is the actress who plays Princess Diana on Netflix’s The Crown, and her true height is much different than Diana’s.

According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who’s Dated Who</a>, Elizabeth was in a relationship with <a href=#>Tom Hiddleston</a> at one point in time. Tom is approximately 6‘2".

According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Mail,</a> they were spotted spending time together in London for the premiere of The Crown Season 5.
