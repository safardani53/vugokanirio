I’ve spent 16 years with these characters now. They are my Marvel Universe, and I love them dearly.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>But since the original film took the movie world by storm with its fierce sense of humor and unapologetic sarcasm, a lot’s changed — its star, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lindsay Lohan</strong></a>, has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>become a mother</a>, for one thing.

In a 2021 interview with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>, Tina mused on how she might approach casting. “The first time we had new actors play these roles [on Broadway], it was like breaking the seal, like, ‘Now these roles belong to more than one set of actors,'” she said at the time. “I’m excited to see who ends up being in the movie.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>According to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>, now we know. <strong>Renee Rapp,&nbsp;</strong>who played the iconic “Plastics” queen Regina George (originally <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rachel McAdams</strong></a>) on Broadway, will revisit her unforgettably mean role for the movie musical. <strong>Angourie Rice</strong> will play lead Cady Heron<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>and Moana star <strong>Auli’i Cravalho&nbsp;</strong>takes over the role of Janis.

Still, Amanda once said she’d be down for a cameo. “It’s been a long legacy for&nbsp;Mean Girls, and I think we all kinda just need to hang,” the actress told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a> back in February 2023.</p><h2>Production Details</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>According to the official Mean Girls musical Twitter account in March, the film has already begun filming in New Jersey.
