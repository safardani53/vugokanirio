Sending my love to the Lagerfeld family and to all closest to him. I am so sorry. We all love you so much.💔 Rest In Peace KL,” she added. She was not the only celebrity feeling the pain of loss after Karl’s death, as many of the biggest stars in the world fled to Twitter and Instagram to mourn.&nbsp; While <strong>Lindsay Lohan, </strong>32, didn’t express her sorry at length like Bella, she was just as sad to hear about Karl’s death. “My heart is broken,” she wrote on Instagram while sharing a picture of her with the Chanel creative director. “Thank you for everything.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“A legend, a hero, a genius, a partner.
