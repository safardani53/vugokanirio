Moira (Susanna Thompson) did not die at Slade Wilson’s (Manu Bennett) hand; instead Oliver saved her from the season 2 attack.

Diggle (<strong>David Ramsey</strong>) insisted that their mission was not over, despite the fact that the Green Arrow ultimately saved Star City. William (<strong>Jack Moore</strong>) then ended up kidnapped, bringing the entire crew together for another operation. Mia (<strong>Katherine McNamara</strong>), whom Sara (<strong>Caity Lotz</strong>) retrieved from the future to attend her father’s funeral, rescued her brother from a man whom Oliver put in prison eight years prior.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Arrow-recap-2.jpg><p><a href=#>Felicity</a> (<strong>Emily Bett Rickards</strong>) returned upon hearing of William’s abduction to help with the search. She <a href=#>wasn’t sure she should meet Mia</a>, but they finally came face-to-face at Oliver’s funeral, where Mia informed her mother that she met and trained with Oliver.</p><p>The best of the Arrowverse — from Barry Allen (<strong>Grant Gustin</strong>) to Kara Danvers (<a href=#><strong>Melissa Benoist</strong></a>) — attended the memorial. Diggle eulogized his “brother” before they all went their separate ways. Roy (<a href=#><strong>Colton Haynes</strong></a>) and Thea (<strong>Willa Holland</strong>) got engaged, Dinah (<strong>Juliana Harkavy</strong>) and Diggle announced their plans to move to Metropolis — a city that still needed saving — and Rene (<strong>Rick Gonzalez</strong>) revealed that he would be succeeding Quentin as mayor of Star City. Diggle’s ending also hinted at his potential as a future Green Lantern.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In the year 2040, the Monitor (<strong>LaMonica Garrett</strong>) transported Felicity to the afterlife to be with Oliver. His eternity was set in Moira’s office, the first place he ever saw his future wife. The couple reunited with a kiss as they rejoiced in having all the time in the world to share.</p><p>Tell&nbsp;Us: What did you think of the&nbsp;Arrow&nbsp;series finale?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJirqp%2BserSx0aKcrGWWnruiuMRmpqWhppq%2FbrLEpaCcoaSuerOx1KegrZ1f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
