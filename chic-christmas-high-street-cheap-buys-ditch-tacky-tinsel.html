worry, you <a href=#>won’t need to go out and spend a fortune</a> to make your home look fabulously festive either.&nbsp;</p><p>We spoke to an interiors <a href=#>influencer</a>, Danielle, who is known as @<a href=# aria-label="dbhome_47 (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">dbhome_47</a> on <a href=#>social media</a>, to get the lowdown on the bargain interior items that we need in our <a href=#>homes</a> this festive season.&nbsp;</p><p>So if you want your home to look chic on a budget, you’ll want to pay attention - and then run to <a href=#>Primark</a>, <a href=#>The Range</a>, <a href=#>Dunelm</a>, <a href=#>Sainsbury's</a> and <a href=#>Home Bargains</a> for these under £10 <a href=#>cheap buys</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only this, but interior lover Danielle also revealed the tacky items you need to ditch this Christmas - and according to her, tinsel has got to go.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more Christmas stories">Read more Christmas stories</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Go for gold&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>If you want to give your mantelpiece a <span id=4d26d46d-1169-47bc-a5fa-7c41284a9a4b class=suggested-link>glow up</span> this December, you’ll need to run to Primark.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/im-bargain-hunter-8-cheap-864942605.jpg><p>Danielle spotted gorgeous gold reindeers in the much loved chain - and they’re only £4 each.</p><p>She also advised that when it comes to sparkle, choose between silver and gold - don’t try both.</p><p>She told Fabulous: “I feel like with gold and silver decor, you either have one or the other.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>“I was always a silver fan but more recently I’m loving the gold.&nbsp;</p><p>“This year I have completely changed my Christmas decor to go gold.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>White Company dupes&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>If the White Company is out of your price range, don’t worry, as Danielle spotted a stunning buy that gives off the same stylish vibes, but without breaking the bank.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/im-bargain-hunter-8-cheap-864942446.jpg><p>Thanks to The Range, you won’t need to scrimp on the style, or make such a large dent in your bank account.&nbsp;</p><p>Danielle spotted white LED houses, for just £5.99 in the chain, as she explained: “These white ceramic houses give me White Company vibes which I just love.&nbsp;</p><p>“No matter what your colour scheme I feel like white is perfect for everything.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>All things neutral</strong></h3><p>If you want to ensure your home looks glamorous this December, according to Danielle, wooden accessories are key.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Dunelm, as well as a wooden christmas tree for only £7 in Primark, which she claimed will ensure your home impresses your guests.</p><p>She added: “This year I’m also loving the neutral stipped back vibes.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ve been trying to add more wood into my home decor and styling and Xmas is no different.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Light it up&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>If you want your home to shine, and smell <span id=664d14c3-fd1b-44e3-86bd-2b27179344ef class=suggested-link>nice</span>, Danielle recommended botanical candles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/im-bargain-hunter-8-cheap-864942515.jpg> <img

src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/im-bargain-hunter-8-cheap-864942473.jpg><p>While The White Company have a large infused candle, which will set you back an eye-watering £95, Danielle has spotted a variety of smaller, affordable alternatives on the high street.</p><p>Sainsbury’s have a small spice infused candle for £9, whilst The Range have a spruce and cedar candle for just £6.</p><p>Danielle explained: “I love these botanical candles.&nbsp;</p><p>“Everyone is loving the <a href=#>Aldi</a> dupe of the White Company infused candles but they’re just a bit too big to me.&nbsp;</p><p>“These smaller ones are great to add to the Christmas decor.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Makes scents&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Not only is Danielle a fan of candles in her home at Christmas time, but she also loves festive diffusers too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/im-bargain-hunter-8-cheap-864942569.jpg><p>The savvy shopper spotted a £4.99 Wickford ceramic diffuser in Home Bargains and was left very impressed.</p><p>The bargain hunter said: “I love that it’s a Christmas decoration but has a dual purpose as it smells great.&nbsp;</p><p>“I usually have diffusers around so I just switch them out with these Christmas ones.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Hostess with the mostess</strong></h3><p>If you’ve got guests coming over for Christmas and want to impress with your hosting skills, Dunelm has your dilemmas answers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/im-bargain-hunter-8-cheap-864942609.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/im-bargain-hunter-8-cheap-864942598.jpg><p>Danielle spotted a range of wooden and wicker hosting items, including place mats and serving boards, for only £10.</p><p>Thrilled with her finds, she claimed: “With hosting items, I love the wood and wicker combination this year.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>No time for tacky&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Thanks to Danielle’s interior recommendations, your home will be sure to leave guests open-mouthed this season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/im-bargain-hunter-8-cheap-864942388.jpg> <img

avoiding”, she said: “Ditch the tinsel and spruce up your Christmas tree with foliage and ribbon.”</p><p>If you want a Christmas tree that will impress your <a href=#>neighbours</a>, Danielle claimed: “I’ve never been a fan of tinsel but I do feel like it fills out the tree.&nbsp;</p><p>“Instead of relying on tinsel I used a mixture of ribbon and glitter foliage to fill out the tree and to make it look stylish.”</p><p>Not only this, but Danielle has rounded up the tacky items that she wouldn’t dare have in her home this December - no matter how much Christmas spirit they bring.</p><p>When it comes to things that are “tacky”, the Christmas pieces that <span id=01554f40-4a37-4175-99ae-de8b9311628a class=suggested-link>spring</span> to mind for Danielle are festive toilet seat covers, artificial rainbow trees and luminous items.&nbsp;</p><p>She explained: “I’m such a neutral girl at heart and Christmas is no different.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“I will definitely be running in the opposite direction when it comes to colourful trees, decor and toilet seat covers.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fabulous will pay for your exclusive stories.
