But I think education’s really important. I love being there. I love learning,” Winter said. “I will continue to keep learning.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In April 2016, Winter celebrated her acceptance into the world-renowned school on social media. “It’s an AMAZING DAY! I’m going to UCLA – thank you to everyone who has been there for me on this journey! #bruinsbaby,” Winter captioned an Instagram photo of her acceptance letter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>WATCH: “Modern Family’s” Ariel Winter Talks Dressing as a ‘Curvy’ Woman for the Emmys</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the fall, the actress, who lives with boyfriend Levi Meaden, opened up about her goals for the future.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I definitely want to continue being an actress. I love it,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Winter told The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “The reason I’m going to college is because I do want knowledge in another field. College isn’t the college experience for me. I’m not going to be in a sorority, I’m not going to network, I’m not even really going to make my lifelong friends.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress has previously spoken about not letting her acting career keep her from furthering her education. At PEOPLE’s SAG Awards pre-show in January 2016, Winter revealed what she would be doing if she didn’t have awards shows to attend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I would be doing exactly what I’m doing, which is going to school, applying to college and wanting to be a social justice lawyer,” she said at the time. “With my personal experience, I would have something good to give.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She had planned on studying pre-law, she told PEOPLE, due to her “tumultuous relationship with the court system.” (She spent years in and out of courts as her guardianship was transferred from her mother, whom she claimed was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>emotionally abusive</a>, to her sister before she successfully petitioned to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>become an emancipated minor</a>.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“With what I’ve gone through, I think it’s really important to become a voice for abuse victims who have no voice,” she said. “I want to be able to make a difference.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6SrfKK%2ByJ6jZq%2BZo8GmvoytmKShnpx6o77EmqJmm5%2BhuaazxGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
