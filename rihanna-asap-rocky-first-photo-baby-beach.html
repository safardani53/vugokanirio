Chilling out in a sherpa blanket in his car seat, the hip hop heir looked adorable as he squealed and smiled before grabbing for his mom’s phone. “You trying to get mummy’s phone? Oh wow…oh wow,” Rihanna could be heard asking him in the clip.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Meanwhile, the Fenty designer may have just <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed</a> her first child with A$AP but a new report tagged the icon as having baby fever again already! “Rihanna always dreamed of being a mom and she takes a lot of pride in it.,” a source told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ET&nbsp;</a>on Nov. 11. “She would love to have more children with A$AP in the future.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The insider added, “Rihanna and A$AP are so in love and have the best time together. They are also a great team when it comes to being parents to their baby boy.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The report certainly adds to the buzz around the “Don’t Stop the Music” singer. With the news of her performing at the 2023 Super Bowl arriving a few weeks ago, the name of her and ASAP’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>7-month old son</a>&nbsp;still a mystery and, per usual,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>questions still surrounding a new album</a>, let’s just say fans are keeping an eye on Rihanna’s every move.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The one thing that appears to be a given is the love between Rihanna and ASAP. A source close to the Fenty designer EXCLUSIVELY told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>that the pair’s relationship is better than it’s ever been. “Rihanna has seen whole different side of Rocky that she’s never known. She’s fallen even more in love with him since they welcomed their son into this world and she cherishes every moment of seeing Rocky and their son bonding,” the insider stated.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Rihanna and A$AP&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>began dating</a>&nbsp;in 2020 after being friends for several years. The pair announced their&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pregnancy news</a>&nbsp;in January of 2021 with an incredible maternity photoshoot in New York City. They then welcomed their son on May 13.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze5BwZquhmJa7r62MmqqaqF2nvKS32GadoqqjqXqxtM6tpmaakZfGbq7EmpqhZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
