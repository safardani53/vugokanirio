The Fox News anchor shared a photo of her version of the party staple on Sunday, February 3, but it was almost immediately met with intense criticism from the Twitterverse.</p><p>In fact, Perino’s initial tweet regarding her Super Bowl Sunday creation – in which she simply declared, “I made queso” alongside a picture of a greasy, light-brown substance – has garnered more than 7,000 comments, the vast majority of which are completely unfavorable.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I made queso <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/WXLFNcZlfU</a></p><p>— Dana Perino (@DanaPerino) <a href=#>February 3, 2019</a></p><p>“That looks like a Porta Potty at a beer festival …” tweeted one naysayer. Added another critic: “It’s a poorly sealed Egyptian sarcophagus.”</p><p>However, while Twitter users struggled to find any kind words for Perino’s ill-fated culinary endeavor, she later tweeted that guests at her Super Bowl gathering seemed to like the dip, noting that it was “gone” while a salad dish still remained. “So … whatever dudes!” she quipped.</p><p>What’s more? The rash of harsh reactions actually entertained Perino during what was otherwise an unexciting championship NFL match-up between the victorious New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams. As she put it, “At least tweets about my terrible queso are more entertaining than this game.”</p><p>On Monday, February 4, the former press secretary to President George W. Bush maintained the defense of her dish, but softened her stance ever so slightly and found the humor in her queso’s now-cemented viral status. When the Twitter account Texas Humor deemed Perino’s dish “no queso” she <a href=#>replied</a>: “Forgive me. And please don’t tell 43!” – a reference to Bush, her former boss and a proud Texan.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I have made better queso,” Perino said on her show, The Daily Briefing With Dana Perino, on Monday,” before revealing she got the recipe from Chili’s online.</p><p>The restaurant chain then chimed in, revealing it was proud of The Five cohost for putting herself out there. “Thank you!” she <a href=#>replied</a>. “I’ve always loved Chili’s. And I did try!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZp%2BnqGK7psPSZpinm5ikv26wwKeYZqiVp7avu4ydnJ%2BdnpnAbrTEq2SqrZWovG6txa2cq2WZqXq4sc2tZK%2Bhopa5cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
