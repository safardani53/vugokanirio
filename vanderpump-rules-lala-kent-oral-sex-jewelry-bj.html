Was he married to someone else when he and Lala started dating? That’s what <strong>Andy Cohen</strong> asked, as it’s been a long standing rumor for a number of years.&nbsp;“You’ve been together for a while. You’re clearly very happy. You denied over the years all of the allegations that your boyfriend was married,” he said before asking, “It seems that maybe&nbsp;he was married when you started dating, correct?” To that, Lala replied,&nbsp;“Well, when I met…Rand…he had a legal separation. So, I don’t see how I did anything wrong.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Then, Lala was asked if she’s just dating Randall to get free gifts (like cars, purses and shoes). And she was not happy about the accusation, as Lala yelled,&nbsp;“Everyone can sit there and be like, ‘Her man does this; her man does that.’ It’s like, ‘OK, you’re just mad ’cause your man doesn’t do that!'” She then continued,&nbsp;“Whenever I make music, it comes out of my pocket. My rent? My man gave me a cap, which, we are well above the cap, so mama payin’ a lot for rent. As far as my cars go, it’s like, ‘Here’s the lease, but you best be payin’ insurance.'”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Finally, Lala was asked to defend her “brand” of feminism, during which Lisa Vanderpump said,&nbsp;“I love Lala, but she’s not exactly the quintessential feminist if she’s talking about, ‘Well, I give a BJ, and I get the jewelry.'” Lala then said,&nbsp;“Keep in mind I am blowing my boyfriend. I’m not blowing some random guy for the jewelry. Come on!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH12e5BuZq%2BZnpmys7zUpqdmqqWhsrR5y5qjmmWbmru1ec6rmKVlo5rFbrbEsJylqqlir6t7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
