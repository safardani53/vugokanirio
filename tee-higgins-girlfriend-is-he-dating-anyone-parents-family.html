There, he&nbsp;won the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship as a sophomore.</p><p>Additionally, the wide receiver was also successful in earning first-team All-ACC in the year 2019. Also, in 2018, the player won the second-team All-ACC.</p><h2>Tee Higgins Girlfriend And Relationship Status</h2><p>Tee Higgins has caught a lot of attention throughout the year. As his admirers increased, the question about his relationship status was also raised.</p><p>But, the wide receiver is a very private person and has not revealed much about his personal life.</p><p>However, Tee’s name has been linked with content creator Jalyn Michelle for some time now. People have been gossiping that Tee Higgins is the father of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Jalyn Michelle’s baby</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But, there is no official statement made by any of them. So, this could be just a rumor.&nbsp;</p><p>Both Tee Higgins and Jalyn Michelle have followed each other on their Instagram. Does this mean anything? We can’t yet answer that since the two are silent on this matter.</p><p>Because there is absolutely no information on what the relationship between the two is, it is safe to assume that Jalyn Michelle is not Tee Higgins girlfriend.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tee Higgins Parents</h2><p>Tee Higgins was born on January 18, 1999, in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to mother Camilla “Lady” Stewart and father Eric Higgins.</p><p>Unfortunately, Eric died on August 30, 2022, at the age of 52. Higgins grew up with his sister, Shakia “Keke” Higgins.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Snapinsta.app_302182156_194803376305996_1279210834556668063_n_1080.jpg><p>Eric Higgins and Lady Stewart ended their marriage when Tamaurice was young. Before their marriage, the pair were together for more than four years.</p><p>After the divorce, Tee started to live with his mother, Camilla. Being a single mother, Stewart gave all the love and support she could to both of their children.</p><p>Since childhood, the wide receiver has been in the custody of Stewart, so he is much closer to his mother than to his father.</p><h2>Lady Stewart Shot In The Head</h2><p>Camilla Stewart, after parting ways with Eric, was in a relationship with a drug dealer boyfriend. Lady Stewart was also addicted to drugs during that time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/etjtzac0ryhyudxyqpjp.jpg><p>Furthermore, the mother was shot in the head by her own boyfriend and a drug dealer when Tee was just 6 years old.</p><p>Tee recalled the time when his teacher pulled him out of kindergarten just after lunch. Then, the young Tee noticed his then-17-year-old sister KeKe in tears when she came to pick him up from school.</p><p>Higgins returned home to a crime scene in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Stewart had already been rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery.</p><p>“When we pulled up to the house, it seemed like there were 100 police officers out front, but I remember the yellow tape more than anything,” Higgins said.</p><p>Miraculously, Lady Stewart’s treatment was successful, and she survived.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunDAxJ5koaGXnLavv4ygoKuklqe2prrDZqCsZZiaeqWt06KloGWRo8awusRmp5qqlaPBtHnFmqSipKlk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
