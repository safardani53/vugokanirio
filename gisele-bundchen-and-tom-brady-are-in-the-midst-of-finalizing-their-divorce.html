Page Six claimed on September 1, 2022, that the supermodel had left their family home in Tampa for Costa Rica after a series of furious disputes over Brady’s stunning choice to return to the NFL.&nbsp;Previously, the NFL quarterback announced his retirement from the league after 22 seasons in February 2022. He pondered on his choice in a long Instagram post.</p><p>“I’ve spent the last week contemplating and asking myself uncomfortable questions.” And I am quite pleased with what we have accomplished. My teammates, coaches, fellow competitors, and fans deserve my full attention, but for the time being, it’s best that I leave the field to the next generation of devoted and motivated sportsmen,” Brady stated.</p><p>But, only a month after declaring his retirement, he announced on Twitter and Instagram that he will be returning to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the 2019 season.</p><h2>Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady Are Divorcing</h2><p>Brady did not accompany his wife to Costa Rica because he needed to remain for team training. According to a source, the couple was arguing and it was nothing new. They’d argued before and always ended up together.&nbsp;Rumors of animosity between the two began after Brady addressed his 11-day absence from training in August. The quarterback described his situation as a “one-of-a-kind challenge.” And tabloids believe it has something to do with his comeback to the NFL.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Gisele-Bundchen-1.jpg alt="Gisele Bündchen" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Bündchen was disappointed with her husband’s choice to terminate his retirement, a source told People.</p><p>“There’s a lot of anxiety. She was overjoyed when he announced his retirement, and she was furious when he changed his mind. They’re going through a hard period. But I know they’re trying to figure it out, or at least he is, and make it work. “He just wants to get through it and for things to go better,” the person added.</p><p>However, on September 7, 2022, Deuxmoi issued a blind item indicating that the pair may be splitting. Neither Bündchen nor Brady, however, have acknowledged their marital status.</p><h2>Tom Brady Discusses Changing Priorities on ‘Let’s Go’</h2><p>Brady discussed his family and how his life changed as he grew older on his SiriusXM program, Let’s Go!, on September 5, 2022, before rumors of his divorce began. However, netizens remarked that he did not specifically mention his wife, despite the fact that she is an essential component of his family.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Gisele-Bundchen-2.jpg alt="Gisele Bündchen" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“When I was 25, all I could think about was football.” Other objectives emerge throughout time as you adapt and grow in various ways. You accept these many duties of family and commitment. “You devote time and attention to those things,” Brady said, thinking about how drastically his life had changed.&nbsp;The quarterback also discussed juggling his personal and professional lives. He claimed that he couldn’t stop enjoying his life while playing sports and that he was attempting to balance the two.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGieoquVobJurtSnm5yglaN6orrDZquopV2Xv6Kw2GaYq51dnrtuwMeeZKahlKjBbrvFZp2ippGhtru1zaBkraCVnr9usMivpqublWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
