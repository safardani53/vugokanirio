Burrows is a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., while Hurts is a member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Burrows graduated in 2017 with a bachelor's degree in Spanish and political science. She then received her MBA at Alabama's Manderson School of Business, according to her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>LinkedIn account</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-lives-in-texas></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She lives in Texas</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Burrows lives and works in Dallas, Texas. It's unclear where she's originally from, but Hurts' family home, where he reportedly resides with his parents during the off-season, is only 240 miles away in Houston, Texas.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hurts grew up in Channelview, Texas, outside of Houston, where he played for the Channelview High School football team with his dad, Averion Hurts, as a coach.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-works-in-the-tech-industry></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She works in the tech industry</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As her graduation approached, Burrows was hired by IBM to start her career as a senior client experience consultant in Dallas. After Alabama's director of corporate sponsorships revealed the news on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>LinkedIn</a>, Burrows wrote, "Counting down the days! Can't wait!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Burrows has risen through the ranks at the technology company, spending time there as a sales executive and software financing leader before taking up her current post as an artificial intelligence partner.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shes-an-mvp-in-her-own-right></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She's an MVP in her own right</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hurts may be the star on the field, but Burrows is the overachiever in the school and business worlds. Burrows was vice <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>president of her school's MBA Association</a> in 2018, and served as captain of the MBA Case Team, something she described as "one of my most memorable moments of grad school," on her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>LinkedIn</a>. She even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>led the team to victory</a> in 2019, winning the national SEC Championship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Burrows was also part of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority as an undergrad, and graduated with honors. "No words to describe the humble reminder of Honors Day at #UA," she told the University, per Alabama's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Twitter</a> account.

She's participated in several educational events, including being a coach in IBM's 8-week Accelerate program in 2022, which is a professional learning track that helps prepare minority undergraduate students for the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>business</a> world. "It was the best time speaking and coaching breakout sessions for a few weeks," she posted following the summit. "I can assure you with these students, the future is in good hands! #BigBlue"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She's also participated in a Manderson Women in Business talk and a Diversity & Inclusion panel in 2021, which she cares deeply about. "I'm fortunate my company allows us the space to converse, listen, and learn from one another," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>she wrote</a> following the panel. "D & I is deeper than gender, skin color, or nationality. It's about lived experiences that define who we are and better our community and workplace."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hurts also does plenty to help others. When he's not on the field, the quarterback regularly spends his time working with multiple charities. In December 2022, he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>spent a day giving back</a> to his community with his "Day of Care" tour in Philadephia, where he made multiple stops to pass out coats, talk about career options with kids from the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>KB Foundation</a> and have lunch with a local high school football team.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2021, Hurts patterned with Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation to spend the day with the struggling family of a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>7-year-old boy with cancer</a>. At the end of the visit, he gifted the mother $30,000 to help get them into a better home. "A moment like that for me, just going in there and meeting everybody, it was fun," he said. "I think what amazes me is how the kids don't even realize maybe what they're dealing with, the circumstances they're in, but they're just happy to be living."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-knows-a-thing-or-two-about-a-good-cocktail></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She knows a thing or two about a good cocktail</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the bio of her (private) <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a>, Burrows simply writes, "love language: wine." But her experience with the alcohol industry goes deeper than that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2016, Burrows interned with Brown-Forman, the parent company of Jack Daniels whiskey, among many other international liquor brands. "Bryonna was able to research customer taste profiles, expand on brand activations and sit in on national marketing strategy planning sessions," her sorority shared at the time.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-loves-the-outdoors></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She loves the outdoors</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She may not play football like her boyfriend, but Burrows still loves to spend time outdoors getting some fresh air. In a 2021 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>LinkedIn post</a> sharing an article about ways to cope with an "always-on" culture, she loved the suggestion to "do something active," calling it a "game changer" for her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I am very #extraverted and being outside recharges me every time!" she wrote in the caption.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-hurts-attended-the-time100-next-gala-in-october-2023></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She and Hurts attended the Time100 Next Gala in October 2023</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Taylor Hill/FilmMagic</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple made their red carpet debut at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Time100 Next Gala</a> in New York City.
