My mother was murdered, violently, in the place she should have felt safest – her own home.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“For the last 161 days, the world around us has moved on,” Heidi said in the post. “But my family and I have been living February 21st on repeat.” Saying her mother had been “stolen from her family,” she added, “She should still be here.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?
