Later, Spanish club FC Barcelona scouted him with a contract. And after completing his treatment, he played for the club’s youth teams at 14.</p><p>From there, Messi excelled in the youth playing from team B.

For the first time, in 2005, he played for his country, Argentina, wearing his jersey. Unfortunately, he got to play only for two minutes as he came on elbowing an opponent.</p><p>Eventually, he made appearances at the 2006 World Cup in Germany.</p><p>There was a&nbsp;<span class=words data-synonyms=perception;recognition;discernment>recognition</span>&nbsp;among&nbsp;<span class=words data-synonyms="some;a few">a few</span>&nbsp;<span class=words data-synonyms=critics;faultfinders;pundits>faultfinders</span>&nbsp;that Messi&nbsp;<span class=words title data-synonyms="underperformed;failed to meet expectations">failed to meet expectations</span> at the 2010 World Cup as Argentina <span class=words data-synonyms="reached;come to">lost in</span>&nbsp;the quarter-finals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/messi-in-argentina-jersey.jpg><p>Consequently, he did not score but <span class=words title data-synonyms=demonstrated;illustrated>illustrated</span> his excellent moves against Nigeria and South Korea <span class=words title data-synonyms="in the;within the">in the</span>&nbsp;<span class=words data-synonyms=group;bunch;gather>group-</span>stage games.</p><p>For instance, he may not have been at his <span class=words data-synonyms=very;exceptionally>exceptional</span>&nbsp;best, but the 2010 World&nbsp;<span class=words data-synonyms=Cup;Glass;Container>Cup</span>&nbsp;was by no&nbsp;<span class=words title data-synonyms=means;implies>implies</span> a write-off for Messi, who frequently shone&nbsp;in his position behind the strikers.</p><p>However, Messi showed his better version at the 2014 World Cup guiding Argentina to the finals. But, again, Argentina lost against Germany despite having extra time.</p><p>In the 2018 World Cup, unfortunately, Argentina’s road to the cup was halted by France in the Round of 16, where Argentina lost 3:4 to France.</p><p>In 2022, he won THE CONMEBOL – UEFA CUP OF CHAMPIONS WINNER with the Argentina National Team.</p><p>The Qatar World Cup 2022 could possibly be Messi’s last World Cup. So he will put all his sweat and blood into winning this competition and add another achievement to his collection.&nbsp;</p><h2>Lionel Messi | Retirement</h2><p>Messi announced a shocking news to retire from international football in June 2016.</p><p>He was disappointed after losing against Chile in the Copa America final in penalty shoot-out. The results were 4-2; only Aguero and Mascherano were able to score for Argentina while the players of Chile missed only once.</p><p>This was his forth major loss in International Tournament.&nbsp;</p><p>But later returned to the international duty after two months of retirement.</p><h2>Lionel Messi | Philanthropy</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Messi suffered from a syndrome. And for the betterment of today’s generation, he established the Leo Messi Foundation in 2007.</p><p>To summarize, the foundation is to support access to education and health care for vulnerable children. Also, funds cover the transport, hospital, and recuperation costs.</p><p>In 2010, he became the goodwill ambassador for UNICEF to support children’s rights.</p><p>In February 2020, he was awarded the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year.</p><p>During the pandemic, he reportedly donated around <strong>$1.1 million</strong> to be split between a Hospital Clinic in Catalunya and Health Centre in Argentina.</p><h2>Lionel Messi | Awards And Achievements</h2><p>Messi had the top of the top starting from a very young age, breaking top records.
