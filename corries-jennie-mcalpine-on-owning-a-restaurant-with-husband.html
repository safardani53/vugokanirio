I’d been in various competitions, such as the Young Comedian of the Year at The Comedy Store in London.
So if I hadn’t done Corrie, I suppose I would have continued doing that. But I’m really glad I didn’t – a) because I love Coronation Street and b) there are still so few women in stand-up.

But I’m really glad I didn’t – a) because I love Coronation Street and b) there are still so few women in stand-up.</p><p><strong>Me and my other half [husband Chris] have a restaurant in Manchester [Annie’s].</strong> I pop in there on the weekends and offer to do the washing up. My favourite thing about Annie’s is the families who come and enjoy themselves. There’s one family who have had loads of celebrations there, including a hen night and two baby showers. It’s nice when people celebrate the milestones in their lives with us.</p><p><strong>I’m rubbish with phone apps.</strong> My mobile has been beautifully decorated by my little boy with PAW Patrol stickers. And Post-it notes on the back of it. I use my phone like a mini fridge for sticking stuff on. I’m not really bothered about having the latest phone or app.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/rexfeatures_4424316k-e1519991717311.jpg><p><strong>My closest celebrity friends who aren’t on Corrie are my ones from the [I’m A Celebrity…] jungle.</strong> I never thought I’d be in a WhatsApp group with Stanley Johnson, Amir Khan and Toff [winner Georgia Toffolo]. When I did I’m A Celebrity, they asked me for three interesting things about myself. I put: not applicable!</p><p><strong>I wish I had a signature scent.</strong> I kind of have a bit of everything. At the moment, I’m using Jo Malone Pomegranate Noir. I like fruity smells like that. But I like all sorts – I’ll shove anything on.</p><p><strong>The last book I read was The Little Big Things </strong>– it’s about Henry Fraser, who had a diving accident and is now paraplegic. He paints with his mouth. He’s the most positive person. He believes that every day can be a good day despite what’s happened to him. It’s really inspiring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/rexfeatures_9268987cy-e1519991799230.jpg><p><strong>My typical Saturday will be with my little boy Albert [three] and our dog, Elvis.</strong> He’s a pug – and crazy. He’s not a puppy, so I can’t use that as an excuse. He’s just a ball of energy. He’s harder work than Albert! I put pictures of Elvis on social media and he’s usually lying next to me comatose after a mad half hour. It’s impossible to get a picture of him and Albert together.</p><p><strong>My favourite tipple is a cup of tea.</strong> ‘Being sensible’ is now probably my middle name since having Albert. Saturdays can only really be done if you stick to tea. My late-night party days are behind me. I’ll maybe have a glass of fizz on special occasions but I’m a bit of a cheapskate. I much prefer Prosecco to champagne.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Coronation Street's Fiz Stape and Beth Tinker have epic fight on the famous cobbles</span><p><strong>Coronation Street Monday, Wednesday & Friday, 7.30pm & 8.30pm, ITV</strong></p><p><strong>Don't know what to watch tonight?
