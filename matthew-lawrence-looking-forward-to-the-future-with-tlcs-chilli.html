Their chemistry is off the charts and he feels like he can totally be himself with her,” a source exclusively tells&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>of Lawrence, 43, and the TLC singer, 53. “Their relationship couldn’t be better, and <a href=#>he can’t wait to see what the future holds</a> for them.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Boy Meets World</a>&nbsp;</i>alum and the “Waterfalls” songstress were<a href=#> first linked in January after spending the 2022 holidays together</a>. Later that month, a second insider told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>that the <a href=#>pair were smitten by their newfound romance</a>.</p><p class=p1>“My life is in complete bloom right now. I get to spend time with an amazing woman like Chilli,” Lawrence — who<a href=#> finalized his divorce</a> from <a href=#><strong>Cheryl Burke</strong></a> in September 2022 — <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>Entertainment Tonight&nbsp;</i>earlier this month</a>, noting they were hoping to have children together. “I’ve never gotten to be able to experience that kind of relationship before. She’s really, really special.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Brotherly Love</a>&nbsp;</i>alum has since clarified his comments, revealing that <a href=#>he is not putting pressure on Chilli</a>.</p><p class=p1>“[My brother]&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Joe [Lawrence]</strong></a>&nbsp;and I were <a href=#>commiserating about this plan that we had to have children together</a> when we were growing up,” Matthew&nbsp;told&nbsp;<i>E! News</i>&nbsp;on March 15,&nbsp;referring to his eldest sibling, 46,&nbsp;who is a father of three. “And I missed the first go around and now <a href=#>he’s starting a new family</a> [with wife <a href=#><strong>Samantha Cope</strong></a>] and I was thinking, ‘Man, it’d be great if we could do it again, when I didn’t have the chance to raise a family together.’ So that’s what I meant by that.”</p><p class=p1>He added: “[Chilli is] an amazing person. She’s already a mother, she has an incredible son. I respect so much as to how she’s raised him. She’d be an incredible mother again, and <a href=#>I’d be incredibly lucky but that’s way in the future</a>.”</p><p class=p1>Chilli — who shares son Tron, 25, with ex&nbsp;<strong>Dallas Austin</strong>&nbsp;— already has the approval of both the&nbsp;<i>Melissa & Joey&nbsp;</i>alum and youngest brother <strong>Andrew Lawrence</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“His brothers absolutely adore her and<a href=#> they completely approve of their relationship</a>. In fact, they have never seen him so happy as he is with her,” the first source adds. “Matthew loves <a href=#>how well she gets along with his family</a>, they hang out all the time and she fits right in. That is something he really values in their relationship because<a href=#> his brothers are everything to him</a>.”</p><p class=p3><i>With reporting by Sarah Jones</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaSptabDjKWYsKqVo7CmecuopqShnpx6p7vRsJirnF2pvG7Ax55kn62kqr%2Bmedaiq6FlpKGwtHnCoaClpJlk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
