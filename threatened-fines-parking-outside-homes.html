Homeowners living near Old Clee Primary Academy in Grimsby have been hit with warning notices.
Bosses at North East Lincolnshire Council tried to tackle the issue of parents parking recklessly during school drop-off hours.
However, the school gate cameras have mistakenly captured locals' cars.
Between 8am and 9am, and 3pm to 4pm, anyone stopping near to the school is liable to be fined under new by-laws."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

There are still parents parking on the corners of junctions.</p><p>“The council should send a traffic warden round and stick a ticket on them all.</p><p>“It’s a minority who don’t want to park a bit further away because they think it’s too far to walk.</p><p>“It’s just laziness.”</p><p>But Katie Tague, 44, who lives next to the school, said the cameras had made an impact.</p><p>She said: “It could be chaos outside, especially when it was raining. There were cars bumper-to-bumper and drivers trying to do three-point turns.</p><p>"There were the little dots in nursery running out the school gates and it was pretty dangerous.</p><p>“The school put signs up which seemed to calm things down and now the cameras are up, it’s not a problem anymore.”</p><p>Drivers caught stopping or parking illegally can reduce the fine to £35 if paid within 14 days.</p><p>Councillor Ron Shepherd, of North East Lincolnshire Council, said: “Schools should be a place that children can go in and out of safely and with relative ease, but vehicles blocking access and traffic being backed up can cause lots of problems.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“By rolling this approach out to more schools in our area, we are making sure that the school gates are once again a safe space for children.”</p><p>Have you been stung by a parking fine?
