She also flaunted a Christmas cap, which seemed to be placed through editing. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“I feel like the Santa [hat] is edited,” a fan also noted.</p><p>“Is that a candy cane in your pocket or are you just happy to see me? MERRY CHRISTMAS!” the diva wrote in her caption.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Lana Rhoades shares a picture without her baby bump on Christmas.</strong> (Photo: Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, the pictures saw Rhoades without her baby bump, creating confusion amongst the fans.</p><p>One follower asked, “She don’t look pregnant what happened?” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“Thought u were pregnant,” another chimed.</p><h2>Lana Rhoades Announced Her Pregnancy in June</h2><p>People started questioning her if she was still pregnant with her baby because she had announced her pregnancy earlier this year.</p><p>In her June 2 Instagram post, Rhoades shared she was <a href=# rel=follow>eight weeks pregnant</a> with a baby. However, she didn’t reveal her <a href=# rel="follow noopener">baby daddy</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>That said, she disclosed that her due date was January 13, 2022, while sharing the photos of her sonogram and medical report.</p><p>She was also questioned by the netizens if she was faking her pregnancy.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>“Am I the only one who doesn’t see no bump on her? I hope u not lying on this pregnancy Lana,” one fan said on Twitter, replying to&nbsp;Rhoades’ pictures with a flat belly.</p><p>To that, the model <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">responded</a> by saying, “Most woman don’t have bumps un till 20 weeks first pregnancy! It’s reliant on your pectoral muscles and how strong they are. I notice a huge difference in my body BUT to others I still look skinny [sic].”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In another tweet on July 10 this year, she similarly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">addressed the question</a> such as “You don’t look pregnant.” At the time, she stated some of the pictures she posted&nbsp;were captured before she was pregnant.</p><p>“I really really wish my stomach was still this tiny! It’s really difficult adjusting to body changes through pregnancy and every body is different!” she added.</p><h2>Is Lana Rhoades Still Pregnant?</h2><p>In the most recent instance, she showed off her baby bump in her December 5 Instagram post, as she shared a seven-second-long mirror-selfie video. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>“every day I fall more in love with her and her personality, and her beautiful belly,” a well-wisher commented on her post.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Cut to the chase — is Rhoades still pregnant? Presumably, yes, because her baby’s birth date is in January 2022.</p><p>And if it is about her ‘no baby bump Christmas picture,’ the picture was likely captured before she was pregnant with her kid.</p><p>In the past, however, Rhoades had a miscarriage after becoming pregnant with her ex-partner’s baby. Due to that, she was allegedly against abortion and always wanted to be a mom and have a kid.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSRo65uvseomJ2do2Kvoq7YZpmupaBjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
