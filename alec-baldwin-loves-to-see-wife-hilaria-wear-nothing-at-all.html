He’s not somebody that ever makes me feel worried about my appearance,” the mom of five continues.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Even if I look like a truck hit me in the morning because I’ve been up with the baby and my hair is crazy, he always tells me, ‘You’re the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen.’ We all know that maybe that’s not true, but I’ll take it <span class=s2>at 5 o’clock</span> in the morning when I have drool on my face and covered in breast milk,” she adds.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alec-Baldwin-Says-His-Favorite-Outfit-For-Hilaria-Baldwin-Is-Nothing-At-All-Inline-1.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>However, when she does get dressed for the day, Baldwin relies on comfortable staples, which are perfect for her on-the-go lifestyle.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I would say my style is pretty simple and no-fuss, especially in quarantine. … I like to be cozy. … I don’t want to feel like I can’t move or else I feel awkward and I don’t feel like myself,” she explains.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I want to wear things where I’m not worried about bringing them to the dry cleaner. I wear a lot of cottons because that’s just the easiest to put in the wash.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I used to complain about dressing up and Alec would joke and say, ‘You can’t wear yoga pants to this one,’ even though I’d pair them with cute boots, a sweater and a jacket depending on the season,” the <i>Living Clearly Method </i>author shares.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Now I look at my dresses, especially since I’m not pregnant anymore, and I’m like, ‘Oh my god. It’d be so fun to dress up!’”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alec-Baldwin-Says-His-Favorite-Outfit-For-Hilaria-Baldwin-Is-Nothing-At-All-Inline-2.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>To amp up her outfits in the meantime, the Spain native relies on headbands and jewelry for a polished look.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“We all loved headbands when we were growing up and <a href=#>Lele </a></span><span class=s1>reinvented them to make them feel new and fresh and go with everything. … Whether you have an amazing blowout and your hair looks really great or it doesn’t, a headband makes you feel more put together. I wear them a lot in the summer because you can just get out of the pool and throw one on and in the winter, you can take off your hat and put one on to avoid hat hair,” she notes.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>As for her go-to baubles: “I have my rings that I wear every day including my wedding ring and I always wear a little bracelet that I never take off. I have a necklace that has five tiny diamonds on it to represent my kids and then I love a nice little pair of <a href=# data-link=1>earrings</a> or hoops.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Although Baldwin i</span><span class=s1>s always dressed to the nines, don’t expect the yoga instructor to give the Saturday Night Live star, 62, fashion tips any time soon.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Alec-Baldwin-Says-His-Favorite-Outfit-For-Hilaria-Baldwin-Is-Nothing-At-All-Inline-3.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Alec has his very own way of dressing and he’s very into it.
