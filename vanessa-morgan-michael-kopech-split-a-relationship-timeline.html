Real Housewives of Atlanta watchers first met Kopech when he appeared on Kim Zolciak’s spinoff series, Don’t Be Tardy, with her eldest daughter, Brielle Biermann. After the athlete started dating Brielle in 2016, he made cameos on seasons 5 and 6 of the reality show — and tried to convince dad Kroy Biermann that he was The One for her."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Why do you care?’ And he said, ‘I like every other ring you usually send me, just not this one.’”</p><p>While Brielle and Kopech planned to move in together in Chicago as the pitcher trained with the White Sox, <a href=#>Us Weekly broke the news in March 2018</a> that the twosome went their separate ways. Brielle’s sister, <a href=#><strong>Ariana Biermann</strong></a>, revealed during a season 7 episode of Don’t Be Tardy that <a href=#>he was the one to pull the plug on their relationship</a>.</p><p>“I’m just, like, not in the mood to talk about Michael right now,” Brielle told the cameras on the February 2019 premiere. “What really sucks is that I had my whole life with Michael planned. I was about to move to Chicago for him.”</p><p>Ariana then quipped, “We never thought he was going to break up with you, and then we were all like, ‘Oh, f—k.’”</p><p>Kroy noted at the time that there was no “warning” sign for the split.</p><p>“I was literally with him for a week and then two days later, he was like, ‘Let’s just take a break,’” Brielle recalled on the show. “And I’m just like, ‘OK, dude.’ Like, ‘I’ll let you know when I’m ready for you.’”</p><p>Kopech subsequently started seeing Morgan, who stars as Toni Topaz on the CW’s Riverdale.
