The 39 year-old has reportedly started dating actress <strong>Natalie Morales</strong>, 32.

Just don’t get her confused with the Access Hollywood host because they’re two different people! John reportedly could really see things working out with Natalie after his heartbreaking split&nbsp;from&nbsp;<strong>Katy Perry</strong>, 32. He’s “telling friends that he’s finally falling in love again, with Natalie,” the insider said. Natalie’s rep has told <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> that this report is false.</p><h3><a href=#>Click Here For Pics Of Former Couple: John Mayer & Katy Perry</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>John had a long on-and-off relationship with Katy that went on for nearly two years. There even rumors that they could get back together after Katy split from <strong>Orlando Bloom</strong>, 40, in March 2017. John pretty much admitted that his latest album <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Search For Everything was about Katy</a>. “Who else would I be thinking about? And by the way, it’s a testament to the fact that I have not dated a lot of people in the last five, six years. That was my only relationship. So it’s like, give me this, people,” he told The New York Times.&nbsp;He even said he’s ready to settle down. “I want to say, ‘We’ll take it,’” to a house with his significant other he envisioned during the interview. “I want the baby with the protective earphones,” [by the side of the stage] he said, which we think would be beyond adorable.
