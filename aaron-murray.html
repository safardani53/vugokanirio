Besides, this was the golden phase of Murray’s life as he achieved a lot.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>Despite being a youngster and just a college student, he didn’t rest and focused on his game.

Moreover, he got selected in the fifth round.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>But Aaron couldn’t do much of a thing in Kansas, and after one year of the contract, he was released by them. Hence, he went to another club, Arizona Cardinals.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>Aaron couldn’t do much at the beginning of his NFL career, unlike his college career. So, he kept on changing the clubs in the beginning years.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>For three years, Aaron was only changing clubs which was hampering his career. Finally, with some unsuccessful performances in NFL in 2020, Aaron retired from NFL after Aaron’s contract with Tampa Bay Vipers was terminated.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s2>Currently, Murray is working as an analyst for college football.
