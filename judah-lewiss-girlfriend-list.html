People born in the year of the snake are idealists. They may appear frigid on the outside, but on the inside, they are warm and eager. Their yearning for sole possession is intense.

Gemini's intense curiosity drives it to be spontaneous, lively, and wonderfully eccentric. This air sign, appropriately represented by the celestial twins, was so interested in so many things that it had to double itself.</p><p>Breaking out in the part of Chris Moreno in the 2015 film Demolition, Lewis would be cast in the lead role in the 2016 horror film The Babysitter.
