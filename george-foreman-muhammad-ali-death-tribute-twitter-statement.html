In what’s widely regarded as one of the greatest sporting moments of the 20th century, the two battled it out for eight rounds before Muhammad knocked out the reigning champ George with one of the most legendary strikes in boxing history, winning back the heavyweight title that had been stripped from him in 1967."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

According to George&nbsp;“I thought he was just one more knockout victim until, about the seventh round, I hit him hard to the jaw and he held me and whispered in my ear: ‘That all you got, George?’ I realized that this ain’t what I thought it was.” One round later Muhammed won back his title.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>George held on to a deep grudge about losing the match until 1981, when talking to a reporter he was finally able to say “I lost” about the match and realized there was no turning back time. Once he was able to let go he said, “After 1981 we became the best of friends. By 1984, we loved each other. I am not closer to anyone else in this life than I am to Muhammad Ali.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Our thoughts are with Muhammad’s family, friends and fans at this sad time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH13e49tZqCdn6e0pnnFqKmepZGjeq7Bx5qkppmUYq6ttYydnJqsmGLBs7XBrqueZaSstrXAxKtkrKyRqbKusc2tZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
