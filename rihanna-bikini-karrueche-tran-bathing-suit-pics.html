She looked like she was having so much fun, taking playful shots at the beach. The red suit popped on her bronze skin and her dark hair hung loose in curls — we are totally digging her dark locks, and it was a really cool contrast next to the bright, vibrant suit. The gorgeous two-piece drew so much attention to her toned stomach and beautiful curves, as&nbsp;the cutouts on the bottoms of the suit were super hot and totally in this season. The backdrop of Brazil totally helped make these photos look so awesome.</p><p><span>Rihanna’s Bikini In Brazil</span></p><h3>Karrueche Competes with Caribbean Queen</h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>Karrueche was ready to compete with the Caribbean queen as the 25-year-old also suited up and stripped down for a bikini selfie — and she did so after RiRi posted her sexy snapshot. The model opted for a tiger bikini and her petite frame looked so good in the exotic suit. While she’s obviously in great shape, the&nbsp;bandeau bikini top didn’t really show off her curves and the overall look was a little bit bland in our opinion. We don’t think she has anything on our girl RiRi! &nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>What do you think? While it looks like Karrueche’s bathroom selfie did not hold its own next to RiRi’s hot beach pics, do you agree?
