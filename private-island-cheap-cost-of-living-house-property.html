commercial use and vary in their zoning to be built upon.</p><p>Many of these islands can even be fitted for full amenities like plumbing and electricity, even in the most remote locations.</p><p>With the average cost of houses coming in at $410,200 in June of 2023, these islands come in under that price tag, even with existing structures.</p><h2>Howard Island, Michigan</h2><p>At 12 miles from the <a href=#>Canadian</a> border at the far tip of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, this island is barely in the <a href=#>United States</a> at all.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on property">Read more on property</h2><p>It recently <a href=#>sold</a> after being listed at $395,000 for land with a two-bedroom cottage already erected.</p><p>The listing boasted "a&nbsp;fireplace, knotty pine interior, large windows looking out on the bay, newly remodeled bathroom, and a new septic tank and field."</p><p>The property also came with a guest house nestled in the woods suitable for four people at a time.</p><p>The garage and boathouse are suitable for a yacht-size boat and other water vehicles, just a short trip from the Drummond Island Yacht Haven.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><h2>Kalgin Island, Alaska</h2><p>This <a href=#>Alaska</a> oasis is as close to private as you can get without having all of the land to yourself.</p><p>For $460,000, an off-grid five-acre lot can be all yours with a beachfront view.</p><p>Although there are technically neighbors, the listing claims that the landowner would only see them if they really wanted to.</p><p>Located in the middle of Cook Inlet off the Kenai Peninsula and about 85 miles by boat to Anchorage, the lot has since been purchased but can be rented at a <a aria-label="weekly price (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">weekly price</a> of $4,500.</p><p>The listing says the land is a "critical wildlife habitat" meaning the nearest neighbor is two miles away.</p><p>At 2,600 square feet, the lodge on the property is a 4-bedroom, 3-bathroom, meant to be rented in the summer for fishing season.</p><h2>The Carolina Cays, North Carolina</h2><p>Starting at $399,000, there are 24 different private islands for sale, all around 10 acres in size.</p><p>They are <a aria-label="off the coast (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">off the coast</a> of the Outer Banks of <a href=#>North Carolina</a> but sit at 12 feet above sea level.</p><p>Their high elevation means that building and development is possible on the land.</p><p>The listing claims that the land has access to "unlimited natural resources," having been a fishing village since the 1500s.</p><p>Each island is near the Virginia Dare Bridge boat launch and minutes away from restaurants, docks, and other mainland amenities.</p><h2>Greer Island, Maine</h2><p>Off the eastern coast of <a href=#>Vinalhaven Island</a> at the edge of Penobscot Bay, this five-acre lot is purchasable for <a aria-label="$395,000 (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$395,000</a>.</p><p>The landowner is able to build an additional 600-square-foot structure on the property.</p><p>There is already an existing small building near the shore of the island that the listing suggests could be a guest house or studio of sorts.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Although secluded and private, the island is not completely cut off from resources.</p><p>At low tide, a sandbar connecting to the main island is walkable and it is just a short trip to Carver's Harbor and a ferry.</p><p class=postsid
