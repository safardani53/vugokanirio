The robot vacuum has a three-stage cleaning process to suck up dust, dirt, and crumbs. With adaptive navigation, the smart device efficiently cleans carpets and hard floors — including the dusty areas under furniture that are hard to reach with stick or upright vacuums. Its built-in sensors also help it detect messier areas and then automatically increases its suction to target the debris. The sensors also help prevent it from bumping into walls and furniture and falling off ledges.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For easy control, you can use the iRobot Home app on a smartphone, which lets you schedule sessions even when you’re not at home. To make things even easier, the app suggests cleaning schedules based on your routine and recommends more cleanings when it's allergy season. You can also control the vacuum with just your voice using Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The vacuum has earned 1,700 five-star ratings from Amazon shoppers, with several calling it a “time saver” in reviews. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">One shopper raved</a> that “[It] greatly reduces my workload.” <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">And another reviewer</a>, who has a “long hair cat” that “sheds constantly,” wrote, “This exceeded my expectations…I would recommend this to anyone who has a pet.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-roomba-671-robot-vacuum-20999-save-140></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Roomba 671 Robot Vacuum, $209.99 (Save $140)</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you want to save even more time and energy cleaning your floors, opt for the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">iRobot Roomba 621 Robot Vacuum</a> while it’s 24 percent off.

Its multi-surface rubber brushes are flexible, which helps prevent hair wrap. It’s also equipped with smart navigation to move in neat rows and learn the layout of a room as it cleans.
