I’m not Gary Cooper, but I’ve had a good run.”</p><p>On his return to <a href=#>California</a>, the blue-eyed boy quickly found TV work.</p><p>His big break came in 1964, when he was cast in soap opera Peyton Place as rich boy Rodney Harrington.</p><p>He became an overnight heart-throb, but was by then married to blonde bombshell actress Joanna Moore, who he wed at 22.</p><p>Joanna gave birth to their daughter Tatum in 1963 and, the following year, son Griffin.</p><p>But Ryan didn’t take to family life — he was too busy enjoying the showbiz whirl of Los Angeles parties — and they divorced in 1967.</p><p>While bagging television parts came easily to the actor, cracking Hollywood proved more tricky.</p><p>He was far from Paramount’s first choice to star in his biggest hit, 1979’s Love Story, with Jon Voight&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Beau Bridges</a> both turning the role down.</p><p>His agent had to practically beg for his audition. Ryan said: “I wanted that part so bad. I tested with 40 other guys to get it.</p><p>"I remember when (co-star) Ali MacGraw kissed me in the test, I thought she really believed it.</p><p>"Later, a friend of mine at Paramount saw the tests and said, ‘Your test was good.</p><p>"There were a couple of good ones, but yours was really good’.</p><p>“And I said, ‘Well, what about when she kissed me? What about that?’.</p><p>“He said, ‘She kissed them all the same’. Welcome to Hollywood.”</p><p>Ryan eventually won the part in the tearjerker, which turned him into an overnight sensation and saw him nominated for an <a href=#>Oscar</a>.</p><p>He was by then married again to another Peyton Place star, Leigh Taylor-Young.</p><p>The couple had a son, Patrick. But they divorced in 1974.</p><p>As Ryan’s fame grew, his temper gained him an uneasy reputation in Hollywood.</p><p>His youthful boxing skills were now put to use in bar-room brawls.</p><p>As early as 1960, Ryan’s temper landed him in trouble after he assaulted a stranger at a New Year’s Eve party.</p><p>He spent the next 51 days in jail.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/actors-ali-macgraw-l-ryan-865148897.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/683fddce-439a-40c1-8eaa-515fd67f21bb.jpg><p>In 1978 he was sued by his friend and publicist, Steve Jaffe, who he knocked unconscious after Jaffe accused him of being rude to his girlfriend.</p><p>Despite his off-screen antics, Ryan continued to make movies.</p><p>He starred alongside Barbra Streisand in the 1972 comedy, What’s Up, Doc?.</p><p>In her book, My Name is Barbra, the star revealed she pushed for Ryan to play opposite her.</p><p>They enjoyed a short-lived romance that ended before the cameras even started rolling.</p><p>Barbra admitted: “I think I was too serious for Ryan.</p><p>"He just wanted to have fun and didn’t like it when I went into my intense mode.</p><p>“So we split, but remained on good terms.</p><p>"Still, it was awkward at times, having to fall in love with him for the camera when all that was over.”</p><p>In 1973 Ryan was paired with his daughter Tatum in the critically acclaimed Paper Moon.</p><p>While the film was a success, ten-year-old Tatum’s performance upstaged him, winning her the Oscar Ryan failed to clinch for Love Story.</p><p>She alleged he “socked” her when she took home the Academy Award and friends said he never got over the blow.</p><p>Ryan denied the claims.</p><p>Nonetheless, their father-daughter relationship was complicated.</p><p>While Tatum — who later married tennis ace John McEnroe — described him as “the most charming, funny, incredible guy”, she also painted a picture of a rage-filled brute who would discard his kids for the attentions of his latest girlfriend.</p><p>Ryan had troubled relationships with most of his children, including Griffin, who claimed his dad made him try cocaine aged 11.</p><p>Ryan admitted being a “hopeless father”.</p><p>The star also battled Jack Nicholson for the affections of Anjelica Huston, who wrote of his “dark side” in her autobiography.</p><p>She claimed he once headbutted her at a Beverly Hills party.</p><p>In 1979, he stole Charlie’s Angel star Farrah from his best pal and raquetball partner, Lee Majors.</p><p>In his 2012 book, Both Of Us, he recalled their first kiss at a party thrown by the talent agent Swifty Lazar.</p><p>He wrote: “She arrives at Lazar’s fabulous home in jeans, boots and a snakeskin jacket. She sparkles.</p><p>“She is a great kisser. She has such sweet breath. I knew by the way she was kissing me she had made up her mind.”</p><p>Ryan was hooked. But with such intense passion, the relationship was stormy from the start.</p><p>Farrah was once photographed with two black eyes.</p><p>She went on to describe her lover as a “loud, rowdy son of a bitch”.</p><p>Ryan admitted: “Farrah and I did occasionally get physical with each other when we fought.</p><p>"But it was not the way that people like to depict it.”</p><p>Their relationship was rocked by challenges.</p><p>Tatum asked Ryan to choose between her and Farrah, causing friction between the two women.</p><p>Even the arrival of their son Redmond in 1985 failed to unite them.</p><p>The couple clashed over different views on parenting and their rows escalated.</p><p>Ryan recalled: “Once, she locks herself in the bathroom and I punch my fist through the door.</p><p>“A piece of wood hits her face, cutting her above the eye. I break a knuckle.”</p><p>The final straw came when Farrah walked in on Ryan with his lover Leslie Stefanson — 25 years his junior — in the <a href=#>Malibu</a> beach house she had shared with him.</p><p>He said: “Farrah walks in. We are naked in bed.</p><p>“Farrah is yanking at the covers to get to my girl, and I’m bouncing around sputtering inanities such as, ‘This isn’t what you think’.”</p><p>While he never recaptured his 1970s heyday, Ryan later enjoyed parts in <a href=#>Desperate Housewives</a> and 90210 and had a regular role in Fox series Bones, which ran until 2017.</p><p>But he claimed that he “wasn’t that good” an actor and “nearly gave up” before his late-in-life renaissance.</p><p>And he couldn’t stay away from Farrah for long.</p><p>The pair settled into a more mature relationship in 2001 but, just five years later, Farrah learned she was seriously ill.</p><p>Ryan nursed her until she died at 62.</p><p>He wrote of her final days: “Her body is dying while her hydrangea-blue eyes are alight with fierce satisfaction.</p><p>“In the coming days I ask her to marry me again and she accepts.</p><p>“I buy the ring. The priest at St John’s Hospital arrives to marry us but administers the last rites instead.”</p><p>He went to his grave insisting she was “the love of my life”.</p><p>His son Patrick has paid poignant tribute to his father and Farrah.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>He said: “Now they meet again. Farrah and Ryan.</p><p>“He has missed her terribly. What an embrace that must be.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/89540adf-6552-48c0-afd5-1041fa38969a.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/279943c5-256f-4718-bec9-4708f16ea0e4.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bfi-press-handout-ryan-oneal-253864496.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/e8b6adcb-4924-4499-8e0c-72d42c1f8c94.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxaGeDcYCRaKmymZ5ivK%2BxwKVkpaemmnqttcWeZJ%2BZoqeuqXnFmq6cnaSpfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
