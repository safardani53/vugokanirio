It has been almost three decades since the original series ended in 1993.
Viewers have become confused, as there are some parts of the new Quantum Leap they’re liking so far, while other aspects of the show seem to be lacking.
The original starred Scott Bakula as Dr. Sam Beckett and ran from 1989 to 1993."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But let's keep going.”</p><p>A second conflicted viewer tweeted: “So far the new #QuantumLeap show is interesting but has flaws.&nbsp;</p><p>“Minor things... No theme song and a romantic vibe between Leaper and Hologram isn't the same as a buddy story.&nbsp;</p><p>“Major things. This leap to the 80's doesn't feel like the 80's. Too much story in the ‘present.’”</p><p>“To be honest I’ve been skeptical about the ‘Al’ character becoming a romantic character,” a third said. “I’m still VERY skeptical, and I don’t think it bodes well for future storytelling.”</p><p>Meanwhile, one happy viewer commented: “This new #QuantumLeap reboot? I'm totally feelin' it.&nbsp;</p><p>“A lot more adventure, a lot more intrigue, hopefully, a lot more romance. I am already looking forward to next Monday's episode.”</p><p>A second shared: “What I love already about the new #QuantumLeap: Deborah Pratt doing the beginning narration again.</p><p>“The relationship between Ben and Addison (imagine Donna being Sam’s Hologram instead of Al).”</p><p>The synopsis for the show shares of what else the reboot centers on: “At the helm of the highly confidential operation is Herbert ‘Magic’ Williams (Ernie Hudson), a no-nonsense career military man who has to answer to his bosses who won’t be happy once they learn about the breach of protocol.&nbsp;</p><p>“The rest of the team at headquarters includes Ian Wright (Mason Alexander Park), who runs the Artificial Intelligence unit ‘Ziggy,’ and Jenn Chou (Nanrisa Lee), who heads up digital security for the project.</p><p>“As Ben leaps from life to life, putting right what once went wrong, it becomes clear that he and the team are on a thrilling journey.&nbsp;</p><p>“However, Addison, Magic, Ian and Jenn know that if they are going to solve the mystery of Ben’s leaps and bring him home, they must act fast or lose him forever.”</p><p>Viewers have mixed reviews about the cast and characters, as well as the writing and storylines so far.</p><p>But most are looking forward to giving the series time to grow, knowing that a lot can change as the season progresses.</p><p>“I caught the first episode of the new #QuantumLeap on my lunch break, and I think it's off to a good, and intriguing, start,” one fan said. “I hope it's successful — I'd like to see where the story is going.”</p><p>A second wrote: “First episode was disappointing. Super cheesy ending but more importantly the 2 main actors (the new Sam and Al) are lackluster. The rest of the cast was fine.”</p><p>A third viewer tweeted: “The lead of the show is good and they might be able to build from that. But everything else was so sloppy”</p><p>Meanwhile a fourth commented: “Bit disappointed in the #QuantumLeap pilot. Seems more like an action adventure show rather than one that showcases intellectual social commentary.&nbsp;</p><p>“Subpar-average writing ends up boring at times. Hoping it gets better, but not counting on it.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“Just watched #QuantumLeap… it’s not great.
