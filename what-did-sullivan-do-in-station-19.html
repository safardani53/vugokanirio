Spoiler Alert: This article contains spoilers for the Season 4 finale of Station 19.
When it comes to Station 19, we can always rely on Sullivan (Boris Kodjoe) and Andy (Jaina Lee Ortiz) to bring the drama and the disappointment. Once again, it looks like the unhappy couple is quarreling over something new, although this time, they’re at Maya (Danielle Savre) and Carina’s (Stefania Spampinato) wedding."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The <a href=#>Station 19</a> promo for the season finale isn’t very forthcoming when it comes to details, but we now know <a href=#>what Sullivan does</a> that upsets Andy — and now viewers are pretty angry too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What did Sullivan do? He betrayed a team member on her wedding day.</h2><p>If anything is clear from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Station 19 Season 4 finale</a>, it’s that Sullivan does something that causes yet another lover’s spat between him and Andy. In the promo, Andy says to Sullivan, “What could you possibly say that would excuse what you did?” So fans are asking, what did he do?&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the hour, Andy and Sullivan fought, but viewers weren't privy to what happened until the end of the episode. As Maya and Carina shared a dance as newlyweds, everyone involved with Station 19 received a message: Maya was fired.</p><p>“This is you,” Andy told Sullivan. “You did this.” And she was absolutely right.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Two days before the wedding, Maya made the choice to rush a badly burned child from a house fire, instead of waiting for an aid car like she was supposed to. The decision saved the kid, but it directly went against the incident commander's orders. He was so furious about Maya not following his orders that he wanted to shut down Station 19.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Sullivan saw what happened as an opportunity. Viewers have watched him struggle with his demotion at the start of Season 4, so he did the unthinkable. He turned on his captain so that he could become the captain once more. He convinced the incident commander that he could get his firehouse back in order and keep everyone in line.</p><p>Although Sullivan seems to have convinced himself that what he did was for the greater good (technically, by just firing Maya, a lot of jobs were saved), he did completely betray someone who considered him a friend — on her wedding day, no less.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Maya leaving 'Station 19'?</h2><p>Danielle Savre took to Twitter after the episode's big reveal to say, "Yeah, that happened. What does it mean? I don't know. We're gonna find out next season. Am I scared? Yeah. Why do we have to ruin a perfectly good wedding?"</p><p>Is Danielle just joking, or is she a little upset about her character's firing? We couldn't blame her if she was. However, as she did say that we'll see what happens to her next season, we know we'll be seeing Maya again.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Andy and Sullivan heading for a divorce?</h2><p>What Sullivan did could have a major ripple effect on his and Andy’s future, as well as the futures of everyone on the team. When Station 19 returns for its fifth season, it appears that we'll be seeing Sullivan as chief, but will Andy be by his side after everything he did? That remains to be seen.</p><p>They always seem to make it through, but fans are quick to point out that they don’t ever hash out their root problems. Sullivan often brushes off the conversation by saying he can’t handle it and he loves Andy, and then they make up. Could this be when it all finally implodes on itself?&nbsp;</p><p>Tune into the Station 19 Season 4 finale on June 3 at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydoJ1lo6q5rbXVmqVmnJ9itq950q2YraGfo3pyhQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
