The hunky quarterback would go on to lead the team to victory in Super Bowl 53 in Feb. of 2019. Tom became the winningest player in Super Bowl history, earning his sixth ring at age 41 and shows no sign of slowing down. He’s spent his entire career with the Patriots and celebrated his 19th anniversary of being drafted by the team in 2000, when he was picked as the 199th player in the draft. In a social media post showing him shirtless with his stats next to him from back on that day, he wrote “More 19 years ago today the @patriots took a chance on the guy in this photo: Me (199) . Thank you to EVERYONE who’s helped me to prove them right!” Tom has gone on to become who many consider the greatest player of all time in the NFL, and his six Super Bowl rings prove that case. He’s showing no signs of slowing down as his health and training regimine are so disciplined and stong that he’s playing at the most elite level in the game into his 40’s, which is extraordinary.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGinopujZMGwuYybqZqcqWLApsTInqqtZaCesLXB0Z6qZqCfqXqxtM6tpqxn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
