To solve this blink-and-you’ll-miss-it problem, Jaguar made an absolutely enormous car called the F-Pace.
It’s an SUV that’s been turning heads the world over since 2016, and is now a staple of mid-range luxury like a Range Rover Velar or Audi Q7.
I reckon it’s one of the best-looking cars on the road (topped, of course, by the even steamier Jaguar F-Type)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Not bad for a car that weighs just shy of two tonnes.</p><p>It’s a Jaguar, so that speed isn’t a surprise.</p><p>But you do expect it to be a nightmare on fuel, and it’s absolutely not.</p><p>Jaguar says it’ll get up to about 130mpg, which is bonkers – and won’t be possible on long journeys without frequent charging.</p><p>But it definitely felt like one of the more fuel-efficient SUVs I’ve driven.</p><p>Better yet, loads of supermarkets and shops let you charge your EV for free (albeit at a snail’s pace).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/C56CF522-BD73-46D2-86BB-B3FDC9DFE5EB.jpeg><p>You can easily juice up to full while doing the weekly shop at Tesco. That’s a range of about 30 miles – so you can drive for free a lot of the time.</p><p>And that’s handy given the model I tested costs nearly £70,000. Every little helps…</p><p>Inside the car you’ll find Jaguar’s new PIVI Pro infotainment system.</p><p>That manifests itself as a large and highly responsive 11.4-inch touchscreen.</p><p>It floats ghost-like above the centre console, offering up all manner of options.</p><p>If you’ve got an iPhone, you can use Apple CarPlay (and I did about half the time, because it’s brilliant).</p><p>But the standard system is great too, with loads of controls over system settings, sound, car functions – and a top-tier sat nav with the best-timed speed camera warnings I’ve ever seen.</p><p>The parking system is brilliant, with handy virtual reversing lines to guide you into a space.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/41895286-CB25-4759-921E-20EE0C2E55DA.jpeg><p>And there’s a top-down view to make sure you’re not smashing into trees, trolleys or nosy Jag enthusiasts.</p><p>I usually find these systems annoying and sod them off for good old-fashioned wing mirrors.</p><p>But Jaguar’s done a ruddy good job making the parking assists genuinely helpful.</p><p>The adaptive cruise control works exactly as you’d hope.</p><p>You flick it to a set speed, and it’ll try its best to reach that speed. If a car is in the way, it’ll match the speed, accelerating and braking to maintain a safe distance.</p><p>The adaptive part is great, because cruise control is so often scuppered by other people not using cruise control. The cheek!</p><p>There’s also lane assist, a blind-spot blinker on the wing mirror to warn you before lane-changes, and a high-beam assist to stop you blinding oncoming cars.</p><p>Basically, there’s loads of stuff that handles the boring bits for you – so you can focus on the driving.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/A07295B5-048B-4003-BE92-3121F8533962.jpeg><p>One particularly handy tool is the collision warning, which will blast a loud alert if it thinks you’re about to smash into a car.</p><p>I had this happen by mistake once, when it thought I was driving straight into a car waiting at a give-way on a sharp corner.</p><p>But though it might occasionally annoy you, it could also save your life. Or at the very least, avoid. a hefty insurance fee.</p><p>In fact, you want it to annoy you. It means it’s working. Like a fire alarm or the siren of a speeding ambulance, we learn to love it.</p><p>You’ve got all the usual mod-cons, of course.</p><p>That includes heated windscreens, two-zone climate controls, a push button to start, valet mode, and a sliding panoramic roof (£1,600 extra!).</p><p>That’s great, but my favourite tech trick were the quick-fold wing mirrors.</p><p>I had them popping in and out almost constantly on some tight Cornish lanes, where an inch or two made all the difference.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6279AAE0-4802-4333-B5DD-D1B681D1506D.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/19EF9319-FAA5-4A26-8279-A3B571D15941.jpeg><p>Given that the Eiger Grey paintjob cost £740 as an extra, I was keen not to scrape any part of the Jag against the endless convoy of vans shuttling between coves.</p><p>The seats are electronic, and can be wiggled in just about every direction.</p><p>That includes a near-horizontal position I’m calling “nap mode”. Not for use while driving, mind you.</p><p>You can heat and cool the seats too, which was great as our trip to Cornwall was half Costa del Sol, half Siberia.</p><p>I know it was really comfy because we drive down south every summer, and I’m usually miserable on the A303 stuck behind the Stonehenge gawkers – but this time I wasn’t.</p><p>Instead, I sat back, relaxed, and let the whomping Meridian sound system pump the Lord of the Rings soundtrack deep into my soul.</p><p>You’ve got easy controls for treble, bass and a thump-tastic subwoofer built into the PIVI Pro.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CCE4D8A0-FD3D-49DC-8478-9A309EE37079.jpeg><p>Sometimes it feels like cars are all merging into one.</p><p>Hatchbacks are ballooning in size, many now effectively SUVs.</p><p>SUVs are getting sportier, reaching phenomenal speeds with breakneck acceleration.</p><p>And sports cars are getting bigger too – just look at the family-sized, road-gobbling Porsche Panamera.</p><p>In some ways then, the Jaguar F-Pace is already the perfect car. The ultimate middle-ground of style, speed and Inspector Gadget interiors.</p><p>Did I mention the free charging at Tesco?</p><p>The F-Pace P400e R-Dynamic HSE as tested was £64,490. The new Jaguar F-Pace 2021 starts at £40,875 – <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">order here</a></p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Best Phone and Gadget tips and hacks</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Looking for tips and hacks for your phone?
