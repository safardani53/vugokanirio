She does, however, step out for the occasional red carpet to support her husband's projects and career.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In March 2023, Barroso, along with three of their four daughters, accompanied Damon to the Los Angeles premiere of his film AIR. Photos captured the family <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sharing a laugh on the red carpet</a>.

During an appearance on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>, Damon revealed that they met in Miami in 2003 while he was shooting the film Stuck on You. "I literally saw her across a crowded room, literally," he recalled. "Eight years and four kids later, that's my life. I don't know how else our paths would've crossed if that didn't happen."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Barroso remembers things a little bit differently. She discussed their first encounter during a rare interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vogue Australia</a> in 2018. At the time, Barroso was working as a bartender, and Damon and his film crew came in for a drink. "Matt's story is that he saw me across the room and there was a light on me. And I'm like, 'Yeah, it was a nightclub — there were lights everywhere!' " she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Damon then came behind the bar to get a break from the crowd. "He had started getting recognized and asked for pictures and autographs, and then it got kind of aggressive because people are drinking and stuff," she explained. "So he came and hid behind the bar … [wanting to] just hang out back there and have a drink. He says, 'Oh, I saw you and I really wanted to talk to you.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Barroso decided to put the actor to work, though. She told him, "'You know, if you're going to be back here, you can't just be standing there!' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He had trained as a bartender for a film years before, so he started making drinks. And he made me a ton of money in tips that night, because of course everyone wanted to go and see him," she continued. "So it turned into a really fun night and then 15 years later here we are!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On April 5, 2023, Damon celebrated <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>20 years since meeting his wife</a> during an appearance on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>The Tonight Show</a>. After host <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Jimmy Fallon</a> mentioned seeing Barroso backstage, Damon confirmed, "Ya, this is the day we met 20 years ago."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shes-a-mom-of-four></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She's a mom of four</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dave Hogan/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Damon and Barroso met, she was a single mom raising her daughter, Alexia, on her own. Since getting together, the couple have welcomed three other daughters: Isabella, Gia and Stella.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Barroso shared with Vogue Australia that one of the traits Damon admired about her when they first met was that she was a mom. "We definitely had a connection right away, it was so easy to talk to each other, we were very comfortable [with each other], and by the end of the night, he invited me to go out with his friends," she recalled. "But I was like, 'I can't, I have a four-year-old daughter, I'm not going anywhere' … and that was one of the things he loved, that I had a daughter."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, "He said, 'I love that you're a mum and that's your priority.' Some guys might have been different, they might think it's complicated, but for him it wasn't. When you meet somebody that you have a connection with, that's just the person that you have a connection with, all the other stuff — the movie-star part — wasn't really a factor. It was just Matt, to me he's just Matt."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-damon-have-been-married-since-2005></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She and Damon have been married since 2005</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>George Pimentel/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Damon and Barroso tied the knot in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>December 2005</a> after two years of dating. The marriage was Damon's first and Barroso's second, as she had previously been married to Alexia's biological father.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead of the couple's 10th anniversary, Damon reflected on marriage and shared the secret to their enduring relationship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm lucky I found my wife," the actor told Entertainment Tonight.

Most notably, Barroso and Damon are close with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Chris Hemsworth</a> and his wife, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Elsa Pataky</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Pataky told PEOPLE, the two couples met through mutual friends and now <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>go on vacations together with their kids</a>. "Chris has been a big fan of Matt Damon, me too, and then when I met his wife I'm even more a fan of his wife," she said. "They are such amazing people. We have three kids, they have four kids, so we ended up making the same plans because everything we do, we do with the kids, so it's easier to do things with people that understand you. And they're very adventurous too, so we were just on holiday in Costa Rica."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Pataky and Barroso have become particularly close over the years, with Pataky citing the fact that they both speak Spanish as one of the reasons. "So for me it's a relief, yes, somebody I can speak Spanish with! We've become very good friends," the Spanish actress and model told PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The two even have matching tattoos that they got after spending Christmas together one year. "We felt like we had to have something to remind us of those great moments we stayed together, and we decided to get a little tattoo [of three dots on their pinkies] all together and we say 'We'll have to do one every year,' " Pataky explained.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In June 2023, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Barroso and Damon vacationed</a> with Hemsworth, Pataky and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Liam Hemsworth</a> on the Greek Island of Mykonos.

He explained that his grandmother passed her ring down to his mother, which was made with "tiny, tiny little diamonds."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They weren't quality diamonds; it was what [Damon's grandfather] could afford," the actor said. "But the marriage lasted. They were married for over 60 years. It wasn't about the ring; it was about the marriage. So when I told my mother that I was marrying Lucy, she gave me that ring and there were these six little diamonds. We took three of them and we put them on the inside of my band, and then we took three and we put them on the inside of her band. So they're not visible, but we're hopefully carrying the best part of that union with us."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-damon-have-matching-tattoos></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She and Damon have matching tattoos</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2013, Barroso talked Damon into spontaneously <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>getting a tattoo</a>: the word "Lucy" (Barroso's nickname) on his upper right arm.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She just announced it," he recalled during a 2021 interview with GQ.

"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Damon explained that he wanted his ink done by tattoo artist Scott Campbell, a friend of his who also did all of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Heath Ledger</a>'s tattoos. "I told him if I ever got a tattoo, he was my first phone call," he explained of Campbell.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not only did Damon get "Lucy" tattooed on his arm, but he also got a tattoo that Ledger had designed himself prior to his 2008 death. Pointing out the abstract design on his right arm, Damon explained, "Heath was an incredibly restless, creative person. He was really sensitive. This stuff just flowed out of him. He was really special."

In an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Esquire</a>, Damon said, "I got lucky. I fell in love with a civilian. Not an actress and not a famous actress at that.

"I had — not to get too personal — negotiated extensively with my wife that I was taking time off.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-106 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added that he made the promise without even knowing if Nolan had anything in the works.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-108 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“This is without knowing whether or not he was working on anything, because he never tells you,” the actor said. “He just calls you out of the blue.
