It’s been a year since you transitioned. The pain is as heavy today as it was a year ago,” the actress, 35, wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> on Tuesday, March 31. “God knows I would give anything to see you again. I didn’t think I was going to survive a second of any of this. Prayers have kept me together. The kids keep me going and Gods Grace and Mercy have carried me this far.”</p><p>She continued, “As today makes a year, I stand strong because of you. Because I know you wouldn’t have it any other way. Because I recall every late night conversation we had about resilience and fear. Because you were my greatest teacher and because you are still with us, in spirit.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nipsey-Hussle-and-Lauren-London-Tribute.jpg><p>London concluded her post, “With every breath i take I honor you. I carry this pain with purpose. I promise I will make you proud. I promise to apply everything you taught me in life and in death. Ermias Asghedom. There will never be another. Until we are together again…. I love you beyond human understanding ( but you know that already).”</p><p>Hussle was <a href=#>fatally shot</a> on March 31, 2019, outside of his Marathon Clothing store in Los Angeles.
