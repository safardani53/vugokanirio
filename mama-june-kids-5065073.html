Mama June shared a news story about the diagnosis from TMZ on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> Story. It was discovered after Anna had revealed that she’d been experiencing stomach pains. She’d reportedly already received her first round of chemotherapy treatment. Honey Boo Boo confirmed the news with an Instagram statement the same day.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“& this is what I mean when I say you never truly know what somebody is going through at home,” she wrote via stories. “No matter how famous they are.

Her father was a man named <strong>David Dunn.&nbsp;</strong>Anna accused her mother’s ex-boyfriend <strong>Mark McDaniel&nbsp;</strong>of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>molesting her</a> when she was a child. Mark was indicted in 2003 for charges relating to the abuse against Anna, but the case was dismissed. He was later arrested on aggravated child molestation charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison, per<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Radar Online</a>.&nbsp;After reports that June had <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reunited with Mark</a> when he was released in 2014, Anna had said she was “hurt” by her mother, and said she believed their relationship “may well be over” to Radar. June admitted to meeting with Mark, but denied dating him in a November 2014 appearance on&nbsp;Dr. Phil.&nbsp;“I want you to know that I’m not in a relationship with Mark McDaniel. I’m not in a relationship at all,” she said at the time, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ABC News.&nbsp;</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Anna also had a daughter&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kaitlyn</a>&nbsp;</strong>when she was a teenager. She married&nbsp;<strong>Michael Cardwell&nbsp;</strong>in 2014, and they had a daughter&nbsp;<strong>Kylee&nbsp;</strong>the following year. The couple separated in 2017.&nbsp;Despite difficult times with her mom in the past, it appears that Anna has reconciled with her mom, and she joined her and her three sisters in walking Mama June <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>down the aisle</a> when she married&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Justin Stroud&nbsp;</strong></a>in a second wedding ceremony in February 2023.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>On December 10, 2023, Mama June took to Instagram to reveal that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Anna had passed away</a>, just nine months after the family disclosed her cancer diagnosis. “With the breaking heart, we are announcing that @annamarie35 is no longer with us,” the reality star captioned an Instagram photo of the family. “She passed away in my home last night peacefully at 11:12 PM. She gave one hell of a fight for 10 months she passed away with her family around her like she won’t and we will will be updating y’all with more information as we get it today. We love y’all and continued prayers and thoughts for our family doing this difficult time.” Anna’s death tragically fell on the birthdate of her youngest daughter, Kylee.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>According to a December 11 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a> report, Anna was a married woman when she died. A marriage certificate obtained by the outlet shows she married boyfriend Eldridge Tony on March 4 in Wilkinson County, Georgia on March 4, 2023. The husband of Anna’s sister, <strong>Lauryn “Pumpkin” Efird</strong> reportedly officiated.
