On Sunday, I was doing the papers with him.</p><p>"I was up at 4.30am doing the papers and trying not to mess up the paper round.</p><p>"It's still got penny chews and the jars of sweets, all those lovely little things."</p><p>However, the actor&nbsp;revealed the shop and his brother were attacked by racists thugs just last year.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News TV</h2></p><p>"The windows were smashed and my brother was attacked last year.<br>"But I'm talking specifically about the 70s and 80s," he said.</p><p>"Often, you'd get people throwing bricks at the windows and the house, they would come in and smash the shop up.</p><p>"My dad was attacked, but he fought back as well, and my brother was attacked, and my mum was spat at. It wasn't a daily occurrence, but it was an angry, volatile time."</p><p>The Bride and Prejudice star went onto explain that he was racially abused at school verbally and physically.</p><p>Nitin recalled: "It was horrible at school, it really was. I'm not in touch with many school friends, but I've got one friend who lives in the Midlands, he's a musician, and I remember him saying to me 'what I liked about you was you got beaten up every day and called the P-word, and you still got up and carried on as if nothing had happened.'</p><p>"Obviously, people will now say that is called trauma and PTSD, that will pop up sooner or later.</p><p>"But I just thought that was normal behaviour. You just go 'this is normal to be called the P-word and spat at.'"</p><p>Masood was the <a href=#>lovable postman</a> and later became joint restaurant owner of Walford East.</p><p>Aside from his constant rows with wife Zainab, Masood was part of a number of memorable storylines including his struggle to accept his son's sexuality and his affair with Jane Beale which resulted in the breakdown of his marriage.</p><p>But Masood didn't stop there, he went onto woo Carol Jackson and had romances with Cathy Beale and Carmel Kazemi.</p><p>Actor Nitin had already starred in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Bride and Prejudice before joining EastEnders.</p><p>In September 2016 he announced he was leaving the role as the last remaining member of the Masood family in Albert Square.</p><p>However, fans were thrilled when Nitin decided to reprise his role in November 2017, bringing with him his two relatives Uncle Arshad and Mariam.</p><p>He left the soap for good in January 2019 and has gone onto star in other British dramas such as Channel 4's The Slate.</p><p>Speaking about his exit, he said: "I can now venture off to new horizons as an actor. I am still deeply attached to Masood and have invested much emotion into making this character memorable.</p><p>"I am in awe of how loved he is by audiences and fans of all ages, from all cultures and religions and walks of life. Thank you. I am humbled by the love."</p><p>The actor has since appeared as a teacher in CBBC series The Worst Witch and a lawyer in Trial and Retribution.</p><p>Meanwhile, on-screen wife Zainab Masood, played by Nina Wadia told The Sun exclusively that she will '100 per cent' <a href=#>return to EastEnders</a> and wants bosses to call her.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p><a href=#>Nina</a>&nbsp;said: "There is always a chance of a comeback, if Enders rang us and said come back, we'd gladly go.</p><p>"We had the time of our lives doing that show."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NINTCHDBPICT000426494714.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The Sun Showbiz team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGlnbYF5hZFtZp6Zo6myr7DEq6pmppmptq95xpqlmqyilnq0tM6pZKqtmal6tLvAqWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
