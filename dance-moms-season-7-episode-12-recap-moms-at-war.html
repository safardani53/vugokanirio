A new dance teacher had rented out her studio, so there was no way she could return to her roots.&nbsp;</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Jamie and Maesi&nbsp;were back in the fold. As you probably already know if you <a href=#>watch Dance Moms online</a>, the mother and daughter quit the ALDC recently over the way Abby was treating them.&nbsp;</p><p>Jamie admitted that she did not want to stand in the way of Maesi’s dreams, but you could tell they only came back to get in front of the cameras.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/abby-lee-miller-is-the-worst-674x1024.jpg><p>We switched gears to the return of The Candy Apples. Cathy could not resist sending zingers Abby’s way about going to prison. She then made a comment about giving Black Patsy’s daughter a solo.&nbsp;</p><p>Black Patsy was not impressed with the reference considering all of the drama in the country.&nbsp;</p><p>Abby started to think about all of the success the ALDC has had over the years. Kira then tried to pull Kalani out of the competition, but there was no way Kalani&nbsp;was going to allow it.&nbsp;</p><p>Camryn, Kalani, Kendall, Nia and Brynn were given the group number. Camry was also selected for a solo, but the other moms questioned whether Camryn even wanted to be part of the team.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/abby-lee-miller-is-the-worst-674x1024.jpg><p>Yolanda revealed that Kalani sent her mom a text saying she "hated all of them."</p><p>Abby then stated that Camryn would be sent home if she lost the competition. After that, everyone seemed to argue about how the competitions would play out.&nbsp;</p><p>The stakes were high because they were going against the Candy Apples. Holly revealed that everyone needed to be unified if the team had any hope of eking out a victory.&nbsp;</p><p>At the venue, Cathy brought a paper red brick wall for Abby to walk down. Abby had it taken down and said that she is not here for the drama.&nbsp;</p><p>The ALDC then confronted Black Patsy about a lewd post she wrote about Kendall on social media. One mom even resorted to throwing an object.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Nicaya got to perform first. It was a decent performance, and Cathy even seemed to think so. Camryn managed to defy the odds and turned in a decent performance.&nbsp;</p><p>After the group number, Camryn admitted that she did not hate her teammates and liked them a lot. Her teammates revealed they wanted her there, too.&nbsp;</p><p>When the results came in, the ALDC&nbsp;took first place in all competitions. The Candy Apples were furious with the result, but there was nothing they could do.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Abby was apprehensive about Camryn, but she was told that Camryn wanted to be on the team, so Abby rewarded her with a jacket.&nbsp;</p><p>The stage was set for Nationals, but will everyone make it there?</p><p>We’ll find out next week!</p><p>What did you think of all the drama?</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Abby Lee Miller: The Beast of the East (Coast)</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2V%2FcLDAp5qeZZ2kurR50p6YrKeeYoRusc%2BiqqiclWJ%2Bc3nRnpqaqF2ivK6%2FjJqrZq%2BRp3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
