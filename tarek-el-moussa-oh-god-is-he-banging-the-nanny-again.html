Tarek writes in the captions.</p><p>Birthdays are a big deal, but gifts of cars are few and far between for people who aren’t family — or in a relationship.</p><p>Tarek goes on to praise Mossy, writing: "She has the most important job in the world."</p><p>In his family’s world, absolutely.</p><p>He clarifies what he means about her job, writing: "which [is] helping me raise Tay and Bray!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"The kids love her so much," Tarek continues. "We couldn’t imagine life without her!!"</p><p>That, by the way, is part of why you should never bang the nanny. A breakup or firing could turn their world upside down.</p><p>"Plus," Tarek adds. "She makes me the best food."</p><p>He is really hyping her up to his fans and followers. Perhaps to explain why she merits the gift of a brand new car.</p><p>"She’s 100 percent part of our family," Tarek affirms. "And we [red heart emoji] her!!"</p><p>It was probably wise of him to highlight that he sees her as a family member before putting any red heart emojis into the mix.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Tarek then makes his announcement.</p><p>"I surprised her with a new Lexus for her birthday," Tarek writes. "At Lexus of Newport Beach."</p><p>Note that he plugs these very specific places and dealers. This may be relevant.</p><p>Tarek continues. "My brother @jaredjstar25 owner of J star motors in Anaheim Hills connected us with the dealer!"</p><p>"Thanks again Jared!" Tarek concludes, tagging: "@jstarautogroup @newportlexus"</p><p>Back when Tarek and Christina were first going through their split, it was said that he romantically pursued his nanny at the time,&nbsp;Alyssa Logan.</p><p>And now there’s this — which some would consider an extravagant gift. Does he have a nanny thing?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Life & Style wrote up an InTouch Weekly post on what their sources say is the real situation between <a href=#>Tarek and the nanny</a>.</p><p>"Friends think he has the hots for Mossy," the insider explains.</p><p>"She’s just his type," the source continues. "And she’s amazing with Brayden and Taylor, which he would find really attractive."</p><p>Some men get their wires crossed and feel automatically attracted to any woman who is taking care of their children.</p><p>Some men are just attracted to any woman who’s attractive, so there’s also that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The insider says: "Being good with kids is definitely something he looks for in a woman."</p><p>But they think that part of this just comes down to his personality.</p><p>"Tarek is a huge flirt," the source describes. "And has always had a thing for hot girls."</p><p>We’re not sure if has a thing for hot girls is super unique.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>So, what does Christina El Moussa think of all of this?</p><p>"She really likes Mossy," the source says.&nbsp;"But rolled her eyes when she found out he’d bought her something that expensive."</p><p>That’s fair, honestly.</p><p>As for the car, the insider has a theory.</p><p>Tarek "really seems like he’s trying to impress her!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Buying someone a car is a big deal, no matter how small of a drop in the bucket the price might be for you.</p><p>We don’t know exactly how much Tarek paid, but the car is $40,000.</p><p>Tarek’s total net worth has been estimated to be around $4 million. That would make this about 1% of his net worth.</p><p>While spending 1% of your net worth just means buying a sandwich if you only have $1,000, that percentage starts meaning a lot more as you accumulate wealth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But, as we said, we don’t know how much he actually shared.</p><p>As <a href=#>Starcasm notes</a>, this post seems less like a gift between lovers and more like a car commercial. This basically seems like product integration.</p><p>They also note that, if this were a romantic relationship, it would seem more likely that he would film her reaction when he first tells her about the gift.</p><p>Instead, he just films her seeing the car while plugging some names. Which is not the sexiest thing that we’ve ever seen on Instagram.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Christina El Moussa Photos: Flip or Flop Hotness!</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY6voJ2dn6h8ta3RnqJmnZxiurDB0qyYZqeYYrSwsIyiqmaglWKvorrGoqWgZaSdsm66wKelsmWRnK6quo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
