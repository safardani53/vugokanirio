She became all All-State 1st team cheerleader as a teenager.</p><p>But later, she developed an interest in wrestling and became a Judo State Champion in wrestling. She was destined to be a fighter.</p><p>Rachael promised her mother that she would get a full-ride scholarship but ended up joining MMA.</p><p>Her career path quickly turned towards fighting; it was as if fighting was something ingrained in her. She never had to learn it.&nbsp;Maybe because she is from Hawaii, as Hawaii natives are taught to battle hard in their tough situation.</p><p>They do not speak out about their problems, but yes, they just fight them out.&nbsp;</p><p>Rachael grew up on the west side, where rowdy kids surrounded her, but luckily, she never had a beef with anyone.</p><p>She made peace with the kids in her neighborhood. This must be some kind of demeanor that she owns, a Lioness who can stay calm at times and yet engage in a fight if necessary.</p><h2>Rachael Ostovich | Mixed Martial Arts Career</h2><h3><span id=Early_career class=mw-headline>Early career</span></h3><p>Rachael initially hopped into MMA in 2010. In the next three years, she gathered an unbreakable amateur record of 6-0. She went on and on and made her professional debut in MMA in Hawaii.</p><h3>Invicta Fighting Championship</h3><p>Slowly and gradually, professional doors to MMA started opening for her. Rachael opted for the all-female Invicta Fighting Championship in December 2014.</p><p>She was placed against Evva Johnson at Invicta FC 10 and took over the match or fight by split decision.</p><p>For the second stint of promotion, Rachael was placed against Andrea Lee on September 12, 2015, at Invicta FC 14.

The fight between Rachael and Paige was scheduled for November 27 but was postponed to January 19, 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>That, too, was possible only after her doctor made a clear declaration and permitted her to fight, as she suffered some injuries after being involved in domestic violence with her then-husband.</p><p>Rachael lost the match against Paige but what matters is she did not give up. She chose to stand up and fight. And her career went on further despite the personal hurdles she was going through.&nbsp;</p><h3>Ostarine Positive And 8 Months Suspension</h3><p>After the ongoing injuries and competing in the UFC three times, Rachael was again back to the game. She was about to face Polyana Viana in August 2019 but was sidelined for some unknown reasons.</p><p>And later, she faced Shana Dobson in February 2020 at UFC Fight Night 168. However, she was out due to a failed drug test.</p><p>As per USADA officials, Rachael tested positive for Ostarine and GW1516, undergoing a drug test on January 3, ruling her out of the competition.</p><p>And according to the policy, both kinds of stuff are subject to ignorance at all times for UFC athletes. Rachael, however, was able to prove that she took the contaminated stuff resulting in flagging.</p><p>As a consequence of this scene, USADA suspended her for eight months and got a four-month credit due to time served under a provisional suspension.</p><p>After her suspension period was over, Rachael faced Gina Mazaney on November 28, 2020. She lost the fight in the third round by TKO from brutal body kicks from Gina.</p><p>UFC released Rachael on December 7, 2020, following three consecutive defeats.</p><h3><span id=Bare-knuckle_boxing class=mw-headline>Bare-Knuckle Boxing</span></h3><p>The Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship announced that Rachael signed the contract with the organization on April 27, 2021.</p><p>Later it was announced that Rachael and Paige were fighting together in the Bare-Knuckle boxing championship.

On November 18, 2018, Rachael was physically assaulted in her hometown of Honolulu.</p><p>Her husband hit her in the face, head, and ribs after a night out with family. She fell to the ground, coughed up blood, and puked many times.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Rachael survived the physical attack making a smart escape through a balcony.</p><p>The following day, she filed a case against her husband and was granted a temporary restraining order effective until May 19, 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>During the case hearing, Rachael’s lawyer presented the recorded audio by the bystander that clearly stated it was a brutal act by Berdon.</p><p>He was heard shouting at her wife, “You are f***** pretty. You can have anyone in your life.” He even threatened her that he would seriously murder her. And what could a girl do after listening to all this?</p><p>Rachael was heard weeping in the background. Both of them were drunk, but the risks rose to that certain level where she had run off a balcony to save her life.&nbsp;</p><p>Judge Trish Morikawa sentenced Berdon to four years of probation after hearing from Rachael, who stated, ” I do have the power to move forward, walking in forgiveness, and I have.”</p><p>Robert Rawson, Deputy Honolulu Prosecuting attorney, actually initiated to punish him and send him to jail for five years.</p><p>But it was Rachael who was kind and strong enough to ask to reduce the jail time. As Rachael knew that her daughter’s mental health might be affected; not being able to see the father for a long time is a little too much for a kid.</p><p>She added, ‘I know how crucial it is to have her father present in her life. I hope he gets the help he needs to become a better father.’</p><h3>Rachael To Own Full Custody Of Her Daughter</h3><p>The police initially accused Berdon of a second-degree attempt to murder, and later the prosecutors charged him with second-degree assault. However, the police released him on bail of $75,000.</p><p>The wicked&nbsp;incident led the couple to end their marriage. They filed for divorce. And the whole custody of their daughter was in Rachael’s hand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Rachael-With-Her-Daughter-RoRu.jpg><p>Berdon can visit his daughter only in the presence of Rachael.</p><p>It is more likely a supervised visit. He can only ask for reconsideration of custody after he completes the anger management and domestic violence intervention course.</p><p>Hold on, people, here is a&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>video</a> that you cannot skip.</p><h3>Controversy With Greg Hardy</h3><p>After this, Rachael was in the limelight for her controversy with Greg Hardy.</p><p>Hardy, a former NFL defensive lineman, was found guilty and arrested for assaulting a woman in 2014. His charges were dropped later.</p><p>And many questioned her about how it feels to be on the same card for the promotion’s ESPN debut at Barclays Center. But she cleared the air saying she had no problem with Greg.</p><p>She added, “Speaking with him, I told him, ‘There’s no negative with me and toward you. I know the media can blow things out of proportion, but just to let you know, that’s not my character. I don’t care. I’m actually happy you’re here, and I’m happy you’re making a comeback, and I hope that me and you can work together on different sides and use it for good.’ Show people that, no matter what, you can turn a bad situation into a good one.”</p><p>She also cleared all the rumors after meeting him in person.</p><h3>New Boyfriend Tumua Tuinei</h3><p>After experiencing a horrible relationship with her ex-husband, she must have had a hard time getting over the trauma. After some time, she gathered enough courage and started a new relationship with comedian Tumua Tuinei.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Rachael-With-Her-Boyfriend.jpg><p>There is no information regarding their exact dating date.
