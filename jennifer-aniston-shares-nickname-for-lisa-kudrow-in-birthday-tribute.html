Aniston and the Easy A star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">virtually reunited in June </a>to interview each other as part of Variety‘s Actors on Actors issue. The SAG Award winner recalled Friends‘ first table read and remembered that Kudrow had already gotten into character.</p><p>“You were wearing an appropriate Phoebe Buffay [outfit] — like, a white linen, hippie shirt, and you had a bunch of seashells and necklaces on,” Aniston said. “And you had your hair pulled up in two little clips, and you had these little blond tendrils. So, so, so beautiful! And <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Courteney [Cox]</strong> </a>had on a pink baby tee with a white trim.”</p><p>Kudrow, for her part, revealed that her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">delivery of one famous line</a> on the show was inspired by her costar <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Matthew Perry.</strong> </a>In the episode, “The One Where Everybody Finds Out,” Phoebe and Rachel (Aniston) catch Chandler (Perry) and Monica (Cox) kissing while in Ross’ (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>David Schwimmer</strong></a>) apartment, which causes Phoebe to yell, “My eyes! My eyes!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I stole [it] from Matthew Perry. That’s how Matthew Perry says things,” the Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion star said. “I actually asked his permission before we shot it. I was like, ‘I don’t know if you’ve seen the rehearsals, but I’m saying ‘My eyes! My eyes!’ the way you do. So I just need to know that that’s OK with you. If not, I’ll say it a different way.’ And he was like, ‘Yeah, go for it.'”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HBO Max announced in February </a>that the cast would come together <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">for a reunion special</a>, originally scheduled to air in May. However, the special has since been postponed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">due to the coronavirus pandemic.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ6jtqex0WaYp6GjqbyvedKhmKudo2K7qq%2FKp5imnV2bvLN5y6KqmmWbqrGzu9ZmoKdlkp6%2FtbTDmrBmrKKer7bAxGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
