She also appeared to have a young assistant join her.&nbsp;In the final shot, Kylie removed the headband and posed with a full face of perfect glam, and the pink toned palette looked stunning. The video had racked up nearly a million likes and four million views within just a few hours.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>When it comes to the art of makeup, North is undoubtedly a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>steadily emerging talent</a>. In fact, her famous mama once shared that North’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cinematic makeup skills</a> nearly got the family in trouble! “North is&nbsp;really into&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>special effects makeup</a>,&nbsp;and she’s really good at it so I have a teacher come and show her special effects makeup where it’s like wounds and blood and tons of stuff,” Kim, told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Allure</a> in a video interview in July.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“She’s actually so good that I rented a house this summer … and she decided not only to prank me and do [the makeup] on her and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chicago</strong></a>, but she made the whole room look like<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> a murder scene</a>.” Kim attempted to tidy up the messy scene, but it didn’t do the trick. A housekeeper arrived the next day to a frightful sight after the reality star left to take the kids to school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/north-west-and-kylie-jenner-on-tiktok-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4 data-skm-boomerang-el-9=processed>“The housekeeper came and tried to call the authorities and called the homeowner thinking that it was a full, real murder scene,” Kim recalled. “I had to let them know that it was completely just a prank and my kids were doing special effects makeup. It was bad.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>North also recently took to TikTok to share her full, rigorous <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>morning and nighttime beauty routine</a> with fans, using her mom’s SKKN skincare line.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5FrZqenoqm1bsPErKtmnJ%2BawG632KWgnmWamruvsdGsZKaZm5rCsXnToqKtp5tiw6qwxKhm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
