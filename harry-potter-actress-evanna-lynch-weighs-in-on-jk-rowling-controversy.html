Though she denied that her views on feminism are transphobic, she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>doubled down on her controversial standpoints</a> in a lengthy essay shared on her website days later.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time, Lynch spoke out <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>and said in since-deleted tweets</a> that "as a friend and admirer of [Rowling] I can't forget what a generous and loving person she is…she is still fighting for vulnerable people. I disagree with her opinion that cis-women are the most vulnerable minority in this situation and I think she's on the wrong side of this debate. But that doesn't mean she has completely lost her humanity."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Dancing with the Stars alum, 31, said in an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Telegraph</a> last week that she "was very naive when I was dragged into that conversation."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I didn't even know there were two sides. I had a view of, like, 'good and bad.' I do have compassion for both sides of the argument. I know what it was like to be a teenager who hated my body so much I wanted to crawl out of my skin, so I have great compassion for trans people, and I don't want to add to their pain," said Lynch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added, "I just felt that her character has always been to advocate for the most vulnerable members of society. The problem is that there's a disagreement over who's the most vulnerable. I do wish people would just give her more grace and listen to her."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Evanna Lynch and J.K.

Rowling and she wrote back and we became pen friends after that. I was in and out of hospital and I would be getting these letters," she said on Dancing with the Stars back in 2018.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Reflecting on the dark period of her life, Lynch added that Rowling's "books and her kindness really made me want to live again." Lynch added, clarifying that Rowling had no part in her casting, "Being in Harry Potter changed my life because it proved to me that I could do something, that I had something to offer the world."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Potter actors Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>each spoke out against Rowling's much-criticized remarks</a> regarding the transgender community. Radcliffe, 33, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>stated definitively</a> in a previous <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=noopener>essay</a> for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=noopener>The Trevor Project</a> that "transgender women are women."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people and goes against all advice given by professional health care associations who have far more expertise on this subject matter than either Jo or I," Radcliffe wrote at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"According to The Trevor Project, 78 percent of transgender and nonbinary youth reported being the subject of discrimination due to their gender identity," he added. "It's clear that we need to do more to support transgender and nonbinary people, not invalidate their identities, and not cause further harm."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: Helena Bonham Carter Says Johnny Depp Is 'Completely Vindicated' and J.K.

Rowling, the author spoke out, saying, "I never set out to upset anyone. However, I was not uncomfortable with getting off my pedestal and what has interested me over the last 10 years and certainly the last few years, the last two, three years, particularly on social media … 'You've ruined your legacy. Oh, you could have been beloved forever, but you chose to say this.' And I think, 'You could not have misunderstood me more profoundly.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">About the situation surrounding Rowling, Lynch told PEOPLE back in May 2021 that she was "still figuring that out, to be honest" and "it makes me sad what's happened." She added of feeling conflicted at the time, "It's an upsetting topic."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52kw6qx0mifmqqirnqxu9OtnKtlkZjBs7HSrGSerpGju6J5y7KlnKBdrLKqs8esZKKmXaS7brbKZqmor5yeu6h5wqilraqfq7Kzv9ho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
