Vallow and 17-year-old Tylee Ryan</a>, has been surrounded by a trail of mysterious deaths -- and a new report uncovers another mystery in her past.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In an exclusive report on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Court TV Live</a> on Tuesday night, journalist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Ashleigh Banfield</a> uncovered the mysterious death of Vallow's older sister, Stacey Lynn Cox Cope, who died suddenly in 1998 at the age of 31. Her cause of death was undetermined.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You can look at one death as a coincidence," Banfield tells PEOPLE, "but these people have had a trail of deaths that seemed natural, and are now under investigation. This may be yet another one."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Authorities are currently taking a renewed look at several other deaths surrounding Vallow and her husband, Chad Daybell.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Vallow's fourth husband, Charles, was shot to death during a July 2019 altercation by her brother, Alex Cox, who claimed he was acting in self-defense and was never charged. Three months later, Chad's wife, Tammy, was found dead in her bed -- a death police later called "suspicious." Her body has been exhumed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In December, Alex Cox was found dead at his girlfriend's house. Authorities have performed an autopsy and the cause of death is still pending.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition, Cox has been alleged as a possible participant in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>non-fatal drive-by shooting of Brandon Boudreaux</a>, whose former wife, Melani, is Lori's adult niece -- and the daughter of her dead sister, Stacey Cox Cope.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Robert Jarvis and Garrett Smith, the attorneys for Melani — now Melani Pawlowski — previously issued a joint statement to PEOPLE denying "the innuendoes and allegations … that she has been involved in any wrongdoing."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She has cooperated with the FBI thoroughly," Smith told PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><b>Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

She is being held on $1 million bond.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Vallow and Daybell are now officially under investigation for possible murder, attempted murder and conspiracy charges.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>an April 9 letter from the Idaho attorney general's office to the Fremont County Prosecutor's Office</a>, the AG's office agreed to assist local prosecutors in their investigation of those possible charges in Fremont County, where Daybell lived with his wife at the time of her death.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Neither Vallow nor Daybell have been charged in connection with any of the deaths.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lori Vallow has pleaded not guilty to charges related to the children's disappearance, and is scheduled for a preliminary court hearing May 7 on those charges.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Vallow's attorney, Mark Means, has not responded to any previous calls by PEOPLE for comment. Both the AG's office and the office of Fremont County Prosecutor Marcia Murdoch declined PEOPLE's request for additional comment on the current investigation into possible additional criminal charges.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Ontq6xjq2fnmWjnsC1sdFmpp9lnKS%2FqnnVmqOlp6dixKm70p5kpKGUqHqivsRmpKKro567qHnDopydZZ2uwLWx0aKmrqucrnqquoxqcHJwXaeysbvRrWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
