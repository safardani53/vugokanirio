Technology is now so advanced a camera can take detailed images and video of drivers from up to a one kilometre (0.6mile) away.
Most cameras though use markings on the road to measure distance over time and so calculate your speed.

though use markings on the road to measure distance over time and so calculate your speed.</p><p>SPECS average <a href=#>speed cameras</a> can calculate average speed over distances between 75 metres and 20 kilometres (12.4 miles).</p><p>They appear in sequence on motorways at least 200 metres apart.</p><p>Cameras that are capable of capturing images and videos of drivers up to one kilometre away have been dubbed “Long Rangers,” according to the <a href=#>RAC</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Motors">Read More on Motors</h2><p>A trial carried out in 2018 saw 1,293 speeding drivers caught by <a href=#>Gloucester</a> <a href=#>Police</a> and could see a national roll-out.</p><h2>TYPES OF SPEED CAMERAS</h2><p>There is a whole range of different types of speed cameras on the market, but in the UK a few key types are common.</p><h3>FIXED SPEED CAMERAS</h3><p>The Gatso was the first speed camera to be installed in the UK and has become the most commonly used in the UK.</p><p>First introduced in 1992, they were painted grey, but due to a change in the law they now have to be painted bright yellow.</p><p>The cameras, which take photos from the rear, might be the most common device on the road.</p><p>Another camera is the Truvelo, which uses a forward-facing lens to catch speeding motorists.</p><p>The Truvelo photographs the driver at the wheel, meaning there can be no disputing who was at the wheel at the time of the offence.</p><h3>MOBILE SPEED CAMERAS</h3><p>These are mostly run by local police forces and can often by found on accident blackspots where there is a history of road traffic incidents over a three year or more period.</p><p>Mobile speed cameras can also be used as part of safety camera partnership teams and speed safety campaigns.</p><p>The cameras can take a number of forms, from&nbsp;marked or unmarked cars, as well as being manually operated by cops using radar guns and laser guns.</p><h3>AVERAGE SPEED CAMERAS</h3><p>SPECS cameras came into operation in 1999 and are becoming increasingly common on UK roads.</p><p>The technology uses digital Automatic Number Plate Reading (ANPR) to record a date and time stamp as you pass between two cameras, enabling the computer to calculate your average speed.</p><p>A Freedom of Information request by the RAC and sent to National Highways and Transport Scotland in 2021 revealed there are 307 miles of major roads in England and Scotland that are covered by permanent <a href=#>average speed cameras</a>, up from 285 miles in 2018.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Motors</h2></p><p>Back in 2016 there were 263 miles of the UK’s roads covered by permanent average speed cameras, including a 99-mile stretch of the A9 in Scotland.</p><p>Average speed cameras are often found at roadworks as well.</p><p>Research carried out by the RAC in 2018 discovered that eight out of 10 drivers thought average speed cameras were better at slowing traffic than traditional fixed ones.</p><h3>VARIABLE SPEED CAMERAS</h3><p>These work in a similar way to average speed cameras but are unlikely to be in constant operation.</p><p>They tend to be found on <a href=#>smart motorways</a> when the speed limit is lowered to ease congestion or when there is poor weather or some sort of hazard.</p><p>The speed cameras are situated on the overhead gantries and a series of signs will display the limit.</p><h3>TRAFFIC LIGHT CAMERAS</h3><p>Traffic light, or “red light” cameras detect vehicles which pass through lights after they have turned red by using sensors or ground loops in the road.</p><p>The system is activated when traffic lights are on red and the camera is ready to photography any car that passes over the trigger.</p><p>It’s an offence for any part of your vehicle to pass the white stop line if a traffic light has turned red.</p><p>Most red light cameras in the UK are made by Gatsometer.</p><p>These Gatso RLC 36 units also have built-in radar technology, with dual speed and red light functions, so for the sake of safety and the law, avoid the temptation to put your foot down when they start to change.</p><p>Drivers have been warned that they could face a £1,000 fine or a month in jail for breaking a <a href=#>little-known speed camera rule</a>.</p><h2
