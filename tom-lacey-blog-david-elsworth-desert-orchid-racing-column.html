Just when you thought things were starting to simmer down, out of left field came trainer-turned-blogger Tom Lacey with a piece that would have even made Robbie Dunne cringe.
He stuck the boot into Bryony Frost, the BHA and the media before insinuating that trainer Jo Davis was somehow at fault for having an owner sexually harass her."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He later removed some of his atrocious views and offered an apology to trainer Gay Kelleway, who was also in his cross-hairs, but the damage was well and truly done.</p><p>Too many in racing are stuck in the past.

I’ve got goosebumps just thinking about it.</p><p>Dessie and ‘Elsie’ were made for one another - the self-proclaimed ‘miserable old bugger’ revealed recently: “Dessie was a miserable old sod as well.&nbsp;</p><p>“If you went into his box while he was eating he would chase you out. He was a proper horse.”</p><p>The 82-year-old has always had the gift of the gab and racing journos could rely on him for a golden line or two.</p><p>When asked about retirement in a Racing Post interview two years ago, he said: “Growing old is a bugger, but I’m alright. Sex four times a week helps.”</p><p>Happy retirement, Elsie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000700440393.jpg><p>Now let's look forward, as there is so much good racing in store in 2022.</p><p>Provided some new Covid-19 variant hasn’t come along and wiped us all out, crowds will return to the Cheltenham Festival in March.</p><p>The likes of <strong>Honeysuckle</strong>, <strong>Shishkin</strong> and <strong>Minella Indo </strong>stormed up the hill to eerie silence last season - hopefully they will be roared on by 60,000 come March.</p><p><strong>Tiger Roll </strong>is still on the go and he could yet try to emulate Red Rum in the Grand National in April. We live in hope.</p><p>Charlie Appleby was dominant on the Flat this summer and with the likes of <strong>Coroebus</strong>, <strong>Native Trail </strong>and <strong>Hurricane Lane</strong>, he could sweep all before him again.</p><p><strong>Stradivarius</strong> will return for another crack at the Gold Cup, the Queen could have a big chance in the Derby with <strong>Reach For The Moon</strong>, and the likes of Buick, Marquand and Doyle will compete for the jockeys' crown in the likely absence of Oisin Murphy.</p><p>There will be storylines all over the place and plenty to enjoy. They don’t call this the great game for nothing.</p><h2>Aren't we Dunne yet?</h2><p>NOW bear with me for a moment while I contradict myself, having just preached the need to be more positive.</p><p>But some jump jockeys are continuing to be uncooperative with the media, nine days after the Robbie Dunne verdict.</p><p>At Cheltenham last Friday, most riders refused to give any interviews in protest over the way the hearing was reported  and were angered when the media dared to question the culture of the weighing room.</p><p>Apparently some more senior members of the riding ranks are still keeping up this ridiculous carry-on.</p><p>When attempting to speak to a high-profile jockey this week, one who has had a good relationship with The Sun for years, I was told where to go.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>It's this sort of insular attitude that has contributed to a lot of the problems emanating from the weighing room.</p><p>The sport needs to pull together.
