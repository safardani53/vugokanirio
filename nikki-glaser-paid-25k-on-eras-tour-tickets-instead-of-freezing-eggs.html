The <a href=#>FBoy Island</a> host revealed she paid $25,000 for tickets to nine different Eras Tour concerts to see <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a> instead of freezing her eggs.</p><p>“I just want to say that it was a conscious decision,” Glaser, 39, said during an appearance on the <a href=#>Kelly Clarkson Show</a> on Monday, October 23. “I’ve been to nine eras tour shows this year. When I’m not on tour, I just go to her tour. It just fills my life up with so much joy.”</p><p>The comedian said not having any children to pay for factored into her equation of spending money on the concerts.</p><p>“I kind of did the math and I’m like ‘If I had kids I’d be paying for like dance camp and swim lessons,’” she said. “I should just use all this money. And I was going to freeze my eggs in January and that’s, like, about how much it costs. And then I just decided not to freeze them, I decided to burn them.”</p><p>“So you saved a lot of money,” <a href=#><strong>Kelly Clarkson</strong></a> replied.</p><p>“Yeah, exactly,” Glaser said. “You know what? I’m going to take that chunk of money that I was going to use to do that and I’m just going to have a really fun summer. So I went buck wild and it was so fun.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Nikki-Glaser-Says-She-Paid-25K-for-9-Eras-Tour-Concert-Tickets-Instead-of-Freezing-Her-Eggs3.jpg><p>Glaser also hilariously revealed that she follows an account on social media that lists the clothes Swift, 33, wears. (Glaser shared with <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> in July 2022 that she owns “upward of 25” Swift shirts.)</p><p>She told Clarkson, 41, that everything listed “under a certain price point” on the fan account she purchases — including one of Swift’s phone cases. “I remember at one point I was filming her and I could see her kind of look and go, ‘Is that my phone?’” Glaser said.</p><p>Glaser is hardly the only celebrity who has enjoyed a night out at the Eras Tour. Stars including <a href=#><strong>Cameron Diaz</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Sofia Vergara</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Channing Tatum</strong></a> have been spotted dressing up and singing along to Swift’s lengthy shows, which feature 44 songs across nine of her 10 albums.</p><p>Now that the U.S. leg of the tour has come to a close, several famous faces have been seen attending the <a href=#>Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour</a> movie. <a href=#><strong>Beyonce</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Maren Morris</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Mariska Hargitay</strong></a> were all seen strutting the red carpet for the premiere.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Nikki-Glaser-Says-She-Paid-25K-for-9-Eras-Tour-Concert-Tickets-Instead-of-Freezing-Her-Eggs4.jpg><p>When <a href=#>Us</a> recently caught up with Glaser, it was a no-brainer to ask her whether she would label Swift’s new boyfriend, <a href=#><strong>Travis Kelce</strong></a>, as a “FBoy” in honor of the reality show she hosts and her love for Swift.</p><p>“I’ve got to say FBoy … that can be reformed and is about to be reformed,” Glaser told Us. “He’s a hot athlete, one of the best athletes out there, and he is [34].”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Glaser added that she thinks Swift can “reform” Kelce, and that he’s already “softening the way I see FBoys soften.”</p><p>“The thing I like about Travis Kelce is that he really knows what a prize she is. … Travis seems to get it,” she said. “The other guys are kind of just like, ‘Yeah, Taylor Swift, whatever.’ … Like, you’re not dying that you’re dating the hottest, coolest, most talented person alive? And he seems to get it. And I love that. And I think that shows growth on her part too, to be attracted to someone like that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKWio5ueeqi4wKycq2WglraleZFuomannmKys63SZquoraJiwaqvyp6rrGWZo8C1scCdZKieXZu%2FprHZoqWgZZWctLR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
