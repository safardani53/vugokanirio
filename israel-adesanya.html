This victory gave him his fifth Performance of the Night award.</p><p>On March 6, 2021, at UFC 259, Israel was required to move up a weight class and faced a pro player, Jan Błachowicz, for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship.</p><p>On Nov 12, 2022, Israel had his first loss via technical knockout in the fifth round for the sixth would-be consecutive win at UFC281 against Alex Pereira.</p><h2>Israel Adesanya | Criticisms</h2><p>The president of UFC,<a href=# rel=noopener> Dana White</a>, regularly mentioned the Israel Adesanya vs. Paulo Costa match as the “Fight of the Year” in every fight press conference before the big fight.</p><p>But, fight supporters saw a very mediocre show as the Stylebender utterly ruled Costa and pulled up a second-round stoppage win to hand Costa his loss.</p><p>With this win, Israel Adesanya has established himself as one of the most prominent mixed martial artists.</p><p>In the post-fight press conference, Dana White stated that it was a “Domination of the Year” for the unbeaten and indisputable king of the Middleweight division.</p><h3>Paulo Costa Was Missing At UFC 253</h3><p>Israel has gained so much regard for his high-level counterstriking that even the most ardent strikers are reluctant to take the fight head-on against Israel Adesanya.</p><p>Later back-to-back choice victories, Israel got himself to blame for requiring solid knockout power.</p><p>Next, Gastelum put up an improbable show next to Israel in five rounds of war; boxers began thinking about how using the bout to Israel Adesanya sway do the jest.</p><p>However, Israel shook the world as he got renowned as the first opponent to KO Robert Whittaker within the octagon.</p><p>Shortly after, Israel’s remarkable courage and his counter-punching displayed a brand.</p><p>Amidst the stoppage success of Paulo Costa, Israel remains to show why he is right on top with Anderson Silva’s likes at the UFC Middleweight analysis.</p><p>Israel Adesanya alighted a cruel left hook to knock Whittaker frost to match the UFC Middleweight Champion back at UFC 243. The opponent paid the price for pushing upon Israel.</p><p>In his initial title stand upon “Soldier of God” Yoel Romero, Israel saw himself as a fighter who needed to counter-punch, pointing to a lackluster execution from both the contestants.</p><p>Romero’s plan may have been saving potential; Israel wants to hit his leads and often depends on his counter-punching into a fatal striker.</p><h3>Continued…</h3><p>Something similar occurred while Israel Adesanya vs. Paulo Costa, wherever Costa did not fight his standard form.</p><p>Also, Dana White proclaimed the bout “ominous” in the post-fight press circuit and felt that he did not know why Paulo Costa fought the way he met the next Israel Adesanya.</p><p>Paulo Costa was supposed to come to heavy, stress Israel, exchange strikes, and land a crushing punch to grab a stoppage win.</p><p>Yet, after all such things were said and done, Israel Adesanya compelled Paulo Costa, all the while giving him the first failure of his MMA career.</p><p>Inside the initial session, UFC analysts could applaud Paulo Costa’s endurance upon a technical striker like Israel Adesanya.</p><p>The Stylebender directed distance cleverly and was able to munch on the lead leg of Paulo Costa, giving him settled him going into the second step.</p><p>Yet there’s an exchange to be made that Paulo Costa may have been staring at bringing the bout to Israel in the later rounds and was keeping his punches to save strength; Costa led to land only 12 strikes in the entire span of the attack.</p><p>UFC president, Dana White, said that Costa could only steer a “hit” as The Stylebender defeated the most dangerous striker in the UFC.</p><h3>Further</h3><p>There’s cause to trust that Paulo Costa left to match Israel’s pace and accuracy. Costa also got taken away in the theatrics, frequently calling out Israel to the octagon’s core.</p><p>Moreover, Costa did not return as he has even next to the likes of Yoel Romero.</p><p>Paulo Costa has proved with opponents who would opt to get a few punches to give any in the switch during the more extensive part.</p><p>Yet, next to someone like Israel Adesanya, it isn’t necessary. Israel doesn’t look to swap except when required.</p><p>The ultimate round upon Kelvin Gastelum, where he hit the past interim contender aside, pulled up an exciting public choice victory.</p><p>Costa’s hesitation in swapping punches could have a lot to do with Israel’s reliability as a counter striker and his strength to pick his leads, as seen in his bout next Robert Whittaker.</p><p>Israel Adesanya is large and has hard power in his hands which gave him an advantage over his foes.</p><p>Israel kept Costa from the striking way and met in with strikes whenever he sought to improve.</p><p>Amidst sustained injury on his lead leg, Israel told the game’s entire step upon a stress fighter like Paulo Costa.</p><p>It was <strong>eerie</strong> to see Costa not take the bout to the pen, although he was getting a massive victory next to Yoel Romero in his latest episode.</p><p>Be that as it may, Israel won the psychic war against Paulo Costa and was directed to ensure a stoppage success upon an unbeaten champion.</p><h3>Final Thing</h3><p>It was assumed that Costa could try to take the boat to the area, with several fight fans demanding that Costa start fighting in the first round to put Israel on the back foot.</p><p>Amidst Henry Cejudo crossing to Brazil to teach and support Paulo Costa, the Brazilian lost to mix his game with a sharp striker like Israel.</p><p>Following all the drama encompassing BJJ, it was shocking to see Paulo Costa not go for the take-down even once and get connected in a trash-talk while frequently asking Israel Adesanya to come to the center of the octagon.</p><p>Israel was ready to abuse Paulo Costa’s game plan and manage the speed of the bout.</p><p>He was ready to pick his shots against one of the most dangerous strikers in the UFC and pull up a stoppage triumph upon a fighter who has done next Yoel Romero’s likes Uriah Hall and Johnny Hendricks and nevermore once strayed off from his form.</p><p>Paulo Costa forever led the bout head-on, fit for a slug-fest even upon the likes of Romero.</p><p>When Paulo Costa seemed calm in the initial round, it wasn’t the right choice to completely replace his combat form in a big matchup versus Israel Adesanya for the UFC Middleweight Championship.</p><h2>Israel Adesanya | Personal Life</h2><p>Before taking up fighting, Adesanya always faced dance contests over New Zealand. He highlighted his love for dancing in a choreographed strike at UFC 243.</p><p>He is a fan of anime and wants to start an anime production company after retiring from fighting.</p><p>His nickname, “The Last Stylebender,” refers to Avatar: The Last Airbender, an anime-influenced cartoon series.</p><p>Israel has the form of one of the show’s central characters, Toph Beifong, tattooed on his forearm. He has endorsed the 2020 New Zealand cannabis referendum.</p><p>Moreover, Adesanya shifted to become the first mixed martial arts champion to sign a Puma sponsorship deal in September 2020.</p><h2>Israel Adesanya | Net Worth, Bonus & Endorsement Deals</h2><p>While he debuted at UFC 221 upon Rob Wilkinson, Israel was on a deal that got him $50k show capital with a win premium of $50k. This is large for someone debuting in the group.</p><p>Making your sham and win salary distinctly is a hostile point in combat sports, but it’s hard to adjust anything else without enough force.</p><p>That night in Australia, Israel ended Wilkinson in the next round, getting the match and winning premium and getting the Night premium’s Performance, saving him an extra $50k.</p><p>With the money he made from his Reebok aid, Israel made an astounding $153k for his first UFC bout.</p><p>In his other fight with Marvin Vettori, Israel’s deal went from $50k/$50k to $53k/$53k.</p><p>Sadly, he didn’t get a bonus that evening. According to The Sports Daily, Israel had career earnings of $2,928,500.</p><p>In the meantime, Israel Adesanya portrays brand endorsement deals with ENGAGE and Peak Milk. Likewise, he also has partnered with the viral Call of Duty.&nbsp;</p><p>Israel has his signature line of t-shirts, hoodies, and accessories with ENGAGE. Additionally, he is also the brand ambassador of Stake.Com.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Furthermore</h3><p>It means he made $106k. His next bout was the prominent game spot, and just like it did in the bout earlier, his show and win capital raised by $3k each, now at $56k/$56k.</p><p>Once again, he got the Performance of The Night, making him $162k that evening.</p><p>He was leaping ahead a few rounds when he encountered Kelvin Gastelum at UFC 236 for the interim Middleweight championship in the 2019 Fight of the Year.</p><p>Israel Adesanya had fought his way up to a $350k flat fee, eliminating his win bonus. With the $50k Fight of the Night bonus, he took back $400k that night.</p><p>It’s not strange that he was given a bonus after closed doors, as Dana White usually did when competitors faced like he did that evening.</p><p>In his bout at UFC 253 with Paulo Costa, Israel was confirmed as a hefty $600k.</p><p>On top of that, his Reebok support money is now at the official level for winners, $40k.</p><p>Usually, with his dismantling of the Brazillian, he got $50k for having the Performance of the Night, adding almost $700k.</p><h2>Israel Adesanya | Quotes</h2><ul><li><b>&nbsp;</b>“If you want to beat me, you should have done it yesterday because every single day, I’m getting better.”&nbsp;</li><li><b>&nbsp;</b>“I draw much inspiration from cartoon characters because they’re more real than most people.”</li><li>“I just speak facts, no shade.
