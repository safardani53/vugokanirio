Do you need advice? Do you need contacts, doctors — ‘ Whatever it may be.”</p><p>The comedian continued, “So we said all of that to Julia and we haven’t, you know, heard back from her, which is fine, that just means there’s special people around her.”</p><p>The <i>Pretty Woman</i> actor <a href=#>previously expressed his support</a> for the actress after she revealed her diagnosis last month. “So sorry you have to go thru this, pal, but I know you will prevail,” Alexander<a href=#>&nbsp;tweeted</a> to her on September 29. “We are here if/when you need and we love you.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>The <i>Veep</i> actress, 56, took to social media on September 28, to make the announcement that she had been <a href=#>diagnosed with breast cancer</a>.</p><p>“1 in 8 women get breast cancer. Today, I’m the one,” she wrote. “The good news is that I have the most glorious group of supportive and caring family and friends, and fantastic insurance through my union.
