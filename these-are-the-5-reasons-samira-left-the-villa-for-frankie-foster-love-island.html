Not all of us are going to miss Frankie quite as much as Samira, but at least she believes that the 22-year-old is worth missing out on a potential £50,000 jackpot.
He may not have survived the public vote last week, but there’s no doubt where Samira is casting hers.

Frankie Appreciated Samira’s ‘Leaving’ Gift</h3><p>Samira left Frankie with a little leaving prezzie, hiding her nightie in his suitcase.</p><p>Cutesy, right?</p><p>After Samira had made the big gesture, Frankie did exactly what you’d expect: shared the facts on social media!</p><p>We’re sure it eased the pain of going home early and Frank’s instant appraisal of his villa girlfriend is just what you need to make that Love Island couple to real-life lovers transition.</p><p><a href=#>https://www.instagram.com/p/BlGr2RRHJQ_/</a></p><h3>2. He Has Been So Excited to Be Reunited With Her</h3><p>The proof is all over Frankie Foster’s Instagram stories, and now it’s just a matter of time before they’re back together.</p><p>Whether they can make it work off the island is a different question.</p><p>But, either way, who wouldn’t want to leave when there’s a handsome rugby player so desperate to see you on the other end.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto aria-describedby=caption-attachment-12132 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/2018/07/frankie2-591x1024.png alt="frankie foster love island" width=310 height=537 sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px">Screencap of Frankie’s Instagram story<span style=text-align:center>&nbsp;</span><h3>3. More of This</h3><p>No wonder heart rates were skyrocketing, with those hip flexors in action. Nice of the other boys to offer a critique too, but all of Frankie’s attention was on Samira.</p><p>Samira, you can have as much of this as you want now you’ve left the villa. Life is one big Hideaway!</p><p></p><h3>4. To Meet His Pooches</h3><p>Frankie has his own family of pooches, who even keep him company during workouts.</p><p>That doesn’t mean he’ll pass up the chance to pose with a cute pup, though.</p><p>It’s almost as if he knows that girls can’t resist the double dose of cuteness…</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BaZkg96l1ZG</p><h3>5. Because Frankie is Really Fit and Into Samira</h3><p>All those rugby passes probably means that Frankie is good with his hands… you know, for carrying the shopping and that.</p><p>After 36 days of loveless Love Island action, Samira was definitely feeling a little vulnerable.</p><p>Frankie came in and saved the day.</p><p>Can we really blame her for following after him like a little puppy dog? Look at him!</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BkqO1JtHpNU/</p><p><strong>WATCH LOVE ISLAND EVERY NIGHT (EXCEPT SATURDAY) ON ITV2, AT 9 PM.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfma61tc2gZqWnppp6qr%2FLmqWdZ6SdsrSxjJqpnmWknbJugYyrnJqrn6PAbr%2FApqCrmV2hsqfAjK2fnmWmnrmtrYyfpqtllqeur7fInmSfp6OpsrN5y6itnmWZqLmiusM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
