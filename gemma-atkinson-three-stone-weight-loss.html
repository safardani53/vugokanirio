The 34-year-old star took to Instagram to reveal that she is now less than her pre-baby weight.
The former Hollyoaks star shared two videos to her account, with one showing her just two weeks after she gave birth - when she still had a small postpartum bump.
Wearing a sports bra and a pair of cropped tracksuit bottoms, Gemma shows off her figure in the clip - with a similar one filmed 16 weeks after welcoming Mia."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That’s lighter than before I was pregnant. When I found out I was pregnant I was 72kg and at my heaviest I was 89kg. So I’ve lost almost 42lbs since having Mia.</p><p>"However, the weight I’ve lost is both muscle and fat. My weight loss goal is to preserve as much muscle as possible, ideally even gain some while at the same time lose as much body fat as possible."</p><p>Gemma goes on to insist that she still has "a long way to go", adding: "Despite looking 'snapped back' in the above video I still have a long way to go when it comes to feeling my best and being at my fittest again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000522798446-e1572808752623.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000432790350.jpg><p>"I want to concentrate on smashing my PB’s again! I used to deadlift 90kg, I’m currently on 20kg. I used to be able to do three pull ups (which was a big deal for me!) at present, I can’t even do one.</p><p>"I used to load up the prowler with weights AND Evil Steve (who’s a big unit) and pull it across the gym, I’ve not even attempted the prowler with no weights yet.</p><p>"There’s a big difference in looking the part to actually being or doing the part. My muscle mass has decreased because at six months pregnant I stopped weight training, my cardiovascular fitness isn’t what it was because I stopped HIIT while pregnant, and my body fat increased because I had a beautiful baby.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NINTCHDBPICT000536630045.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Strictly's Gorka Marquez reveals he's got the 'best of both worlds' with Gemma Atkinson</span><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most Read In TV & Showbiz</h2></p><p>"I started light cardio at 10 weeks postpartum and light weight training at 13 weeks postpartum.
