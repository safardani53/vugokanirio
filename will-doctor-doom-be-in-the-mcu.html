The MCU is ever expanding, and thanks to Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, weâ€™re meeting new characters at an exponential rate. After being introduced to Mister Fantastic in the new Doctor Strange film, weâ€™re now expecting even more characters from the Fantastic Four comic books to pop up in the movies, especially Doctor Doom."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Not only that but thereâ€™s barely even been a reference to the multiverseâ€™s Big Bad. While some expect <a href=#>Kang the Conqueror</a> to be the next <a href=#>Thanos</a>, others think that it could be Doctor Doom. So will Doctor Doom be in the MCU?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Many fans think Doctor Doom could be in the MCU as soon as this year.</h2><p>The final MCU movie slated for 2022 is <a href=#>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</a>, and itâ€™s highly likely that <a href=#>Doctor Doom</a> will make an appearance in the film. If he doesnâ€™t, weâ€™re all expecting at least a reference to the Marvel villain. Doctor Doom is known for his dictator-like ways as the leader of the fictional planet Latveria, which hasnâ€™t (yet) been mentioned in the MCU. However, a leak revealed that an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">early version of Black Widowâ€™s script</a> had a mention of Latveria.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src>Article continues below advertisement<p>In the comic books, <a href=#>Doctor Doom</a> is not only a villainous leader but also a brilliant scientist and sorcerer, meaning he could be one of the few people to be able to defeat Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch, and Mister Fantastic, his main archnemesis. In addition, he notoriously takes over several countries in Africa before setting his sights on Wakanda, so itâ€™s very possible heâ€™ll make his first MCU appearance in <a href=#>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Itâ€™s not confirmed that Doctor Doom will be in the MCU, but itâ€™s very likely.</h2><p>While thereâ€™s no confirmation yet that Doctor Doom will make an appearance in the MCU, we all know that Marvel Studios loves to hold the cards close to its proverbial chest. Doctor Doom is one of those characters we would never find out about for sure until he actually appears, like the reveal of the three Spider-Men or <a href=#>Patrick Stewartâ€™s Professor X</a>.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>Regardless, Doctor Doom is a major villain in the comic books, and with Fantastic Four coming soon, Doom is the natural next fit as the MCUâ€™s next big bad. So who could take on such a role? Well, many A Quiet Place fans are hoping that John Krasinski reprises his role as <a href=#>Reed Richards</a> officially in Fantastic Four and that his wife, Emily Blunt, joins him as <a href=#>Sue Storm</a>. This leaves the other A Quiet Place 2 star, Cillian Murphy, to play a haunting Doctor Doom.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This would be a great cast for the MCU Fantastic Four</p><p>Reed Richards - John Krasinski<br>Sue Storm - Emily Blunt<br>Doctor Doom - Cillian Murphy <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/p0Lb9VDuKX</a></p>â€” BLURAYANGEL ðŸ¦‡ (@blurayangel) <a href=#>May 8, 2022</a></figure>Article continues below advertisement<p>Other options include some classic villain actors, such as Johnny Depp (although this seems unlikely due to the controversy currently surrounding him) and <a href=#>Adam Driver</a>, who expertly played Star Wars villain <a href=#>Kylo Ren</a>. On the other hand, Doctor Doom is Romani, so it's important for the MCU to have ample representation and work to cast a Romani actor in the role.</p><p>We donâ€™t yet have an answer as to if Doctor Doom will be in the MCU, but it seems likely that heâ€™ll make an appearance even before the long-rumored <a href=#>Mephisto</a>. And since the MCU is now a never-ending pool of content, Doomâ€™s addition is more a matter of when than if.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLatuIydppysn6d6pbvOpmSbnV2eu27Ax55kppul</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
