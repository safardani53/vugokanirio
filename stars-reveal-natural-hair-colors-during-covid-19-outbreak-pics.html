As the nation continues to uphold the government’s social-distancing guidelines amid the COVID-19 pandemic, stars are missing their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hair appointments</a> to keep up with their color or subtle root maintenance. But for some, it’s proving not to be an issue.<p>Across the country, businesses such as hair salons and other beauty-related services have had to close their doors for the foreseeable future as the coronavirus continues to spread at a jarring rate. And since everyone’s self-quarantining, that means home visits from their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">glam squad</a> are basically out of the question for stars, too.</p><p>Some of the first celebs to get personal about their hair color on social media were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kelly Ripa</strong></a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kevin Hart</strong></a>. On Saturday, March 21, Hart shared a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">4-minute IGTV video</a> as part of a series he’s named “Confessions With Kev.” In the accompanying caption, the comedian wrote, “P.S I have always had a shit load of grey hair…I was just a frequent dyer 😂😂😂😂…I’m not working right now so I said F–K IT 😂😂😂.”</p><p>The next day, on March 22, Ripa posted a photo of her hair on her Instagram Story with a hint of comedic flair. The 49-year old mom of three wrote a text overlay on the pic that read, “Root watch week one.”</p><p>Other stars are getting open and honest about their grays, too. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kyle Richards</strong></a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tamera Mowry</strong></a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Teddi Mellencamp</strong></a> are among those who have shared their struggles on social media — along with empowering messages of self-love.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Mowry is a great example of celebs staying positive during such a confusing and scary time. The Disney Channel alum shared a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fresh-faced selfie</a> with her hair away from her face in a braid. She captioned the stunning photo, “Hello grays. No getting my hair done during #socialdistancing, and I’m okay with it!”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see these celebs and more getting real about their natural hair color — and inspiring others to do the same.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvSrZirq12nsrexwKVkp5mkqr%2BiuIyhmKKqXZi8rbvRrGSdraKeu6h5wqitopxdZoZuu9StmaudkaB6sbXCrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
