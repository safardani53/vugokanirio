So I did this to get the attention of <strong>Adam Mosseri</strong> and Instagrams attention, to ask why are you trying to censor smaller businesses and not bigger name companies? If you’re going to treat it fairly, you should treat them fairly across the board.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The businesswoman has yet to hear from Adam or Instagram, but she did receive a shocking response from Facebook. “The only feedback I’ve gotten from Facebook so far is to label myself as a male the next time I create an account so that I wouldn’t get taken down,” Julia claimed. “Men are allowed to be topless and shirtless on Instagram. So, I guess you label yourself as a man and you show more skin than I guess the algorithm doesn’t pick up on it?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Julia-Rose-Hollyboob-excl-embed-2.jpg alt width=620 height=827 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The prankster added that she is fighting this fight for not only herself, but other women and the future of women. “I feel like if someone doesn’t do something about it soon, it’s going to continue to be a problem. And there’s going to be another girl who is sitting in my spot, you know, months, years from now dealing with the same issue,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>When it comes to her next stunt, Julia said there’s “always something” up her sleeve. “It’s just how to one up this,” she laughed. “You know, I think it’s just like, where do we go from here now?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze49uZqGnnKHGo7vOm2SjrZyerm6%2BzqycZqGeqbKzwsiermg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
