Political allegiances, for many, determine whether someone ignores <a href=#>crimes from one public figure</a> or pundit or decides to brutally castigate them.</p><p>The one issue that thankfully hasn't been politicized, however, is child endangerment, which was the subject of To Catch a Predator. So, why did the show <a href=#>get canceled</a>?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did 'To Catch a Predator' end? Many speculate entrapment had something to do with it.</h2><p>If you aren't familiar with the premise of the show, here's how a typical episode would go down: An <a href=#>undercover officer</a> posing as a minor would troll forums and chat rooms looking for pedophiles. They would then set up a time and place to meet with said local predator, usually, a house they are pretending belongs to their parents.</p><p>When the predator would show up, they'd meet with the officer posing as a minor, and the officer in question would typically pretend to leave the room for something.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>The perp then waits for the "minor" to return and instead of the officer coming back from whatever room they entered, it's host <a href=#>Chris Hansen</a>. He informs the predator that they're on a TV show and that there's local law enforcement tracking their every move. The home that they're in is rigged with cameras and usually, the perps end up getting arrested for attempting to sleep with someone who is underage.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Why did they ever cancel To Catch a Predator.

Was it really because of entrapment complaints?</h2><p>The show didn't ultimately cave to criticism about "entrapment." By going to the location of their own volition to try and sleep with someone they believed to be a minor, the perps on To Catch a Predator were freely attempting to engage in illegal activity on their own. So, it wasn't really entrapment.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We need to bring back to catch a predator, they used to get like 20 people in 3 days that’s insane!

The real reason is actually very tragic.</p><p>In 2008, Assistant District Attorney in Rockwall County, Texas, Louis Conradt, was caught talking to a volunteer who was acting as a 13-year-old boy. Their conversation escalated, and Conradt exchanged photos with the volunteer, giving officers the incentive needed to invade his home since he didn't show up to the meeting he had originally planned with the person he believed to be a minor.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Well it's happened again, it's 3 am and I'm about half a mile deep into To Catch a Predator clips on YouTube.

When authorities charged into his house with a camera crew, Conradt grabbed a gun and shot himself.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Does anyone else remember To Catch a Predator?
