In the June issue of More magazine, the actress, now 52, admits that she opted to get her lips plumped up in the wake of her divorce from Phil Bronstein six years ago.
Stone explains her rationale at the time: &#34;Nobody loved me. I'm 103.

I'm 103. My life would be better if I had better lips."</p><p>After doctors injected her lips (she doesn't recall what the substance was), the star was horrified. "What the hell?" she said, adding that her mismatched lips made her look "like a trout."</p><p>Sans plumped-up lips, Stone says she finds herself chased by younger men. "I really get pursued by men in their twenties, like, a lot," she says. "They probably know there's food in the fridge and that somebody’s there to talk to them and ask them how their day was."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>For the most part, however, the actress says she's single. "Life and love is like the ocean," she muses. "Sometimes the tide is in and sometimes the tide is out, and sometimes it's like the frigging Mojave." Right now, she jokes, "For me? It's Mojave! Fortunately, I like the desert. I'm a desert flower."</p><p>The Basic Instinct star calls herself "like a Prohibition-era flapper, I'm like a juke-joint hussy… shamelessness is closer to godliness. You have to put shame down."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGasoJGnvK950q2mp51dnnqtu86knJ1lnJ64pnnAZqurp6WpeqKy056pZqiclsC1tcJmqq6ql5q%2FunmRaWhpaWhqfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
