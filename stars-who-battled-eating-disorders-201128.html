Taylor Swift, Laurie Hernandez and more celebrities have opened up about struggling with their body image and battling eating disorders.
In her Netflix documentary, Miss Americana, the Grammy winner revealed that seeing “pictures of myself every day” could send her into a spiral. “A picture of me where I feel like I looked like my tummy was too big, or … someone said that I looked pregnant … and that’ll just trigger me to just starve a little bit — just stop eating,” she said in the film."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She told Us Weekly exclusively in June 2021 that <a href=#>her habits were “obsessive and unhealthy”</a> — but she didn’t realize it right away.</p><p>“Honestly, it was a really long up and down journey of understanding food and understanding how I saw food and how my body received food,” the Dancing With the Stars alum explained at the time. “There was a lot of learning and a lot of patience and grace involved. … Now I don’t count or track calories. I’m just kind of eating clean, because I also know that food is a fuel and for what I do and it is important to eat healthy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scroll down to which celebs have bravely overcome their struggles.</p><p>If you or someone you know struggles with an eating disorder, visit the <a href=#>National Association of Anorexia Nervosa & Associated Disorders (ANAD) website</a> or call their hotline at (888)-375-7767 to get help.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNkwLWt0axksKCfYq%2BiwNOlnJ1llZbBqrrGZpuiq5%2Bnsaa%2B0mZpaWlhZ4Vw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
