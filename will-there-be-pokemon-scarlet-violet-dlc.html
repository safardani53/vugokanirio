When it comes to the newly-released <a href=#>Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet</a>, players can start a whole new quest to become Pokémon masters in the Paldea region. Here, trainers can catch, train, and battle with new species from the ninth generation of Pokémon. Plenty of new quests and stories await you in the latest mainline offering of the world-renowned Pokémon franchise.</p><p>But even in a brand new Pokémon title, there's only so much you can do at launch. Despite the game's vast open world and three possible main storylines to check out, you may find yourself breezing through the game in its current form if you're playing obsessively (and who wouldn't?). In which case, you're probably holding out for <a href=#>DLC</a> for Scarlet and Violet.</p><p>On Pokémon Day 2023, new information was unveiled regarding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two new DLC expansions</a> for the game. Let's break them down.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Nintendo</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will there be DLC for 'Pokémon Scarlet' and Violet? Here's what we know so far.</h2><p>Recent mainline titles in the Pokémon game series have had DLC expansions come to the game shortly after launch. Far from being short-term additions to the initial launch, these expansions typically include new Legendary Pokémon, new areas, and new storylines for players to explore.</p><p>The 2019 release of Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield was followed in 2020 by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two DLC expansion packs</a>. These came in the form of The Isle of Armor in June and The Crown Tundra in October.</p><p>In 2023 during the annual Pokémon Day celebration on Feb. 27, the Pokémon Company hosted a special Pokémon Presents livestream. The conference featured plenty of news on upcoming titles and projects like Pokémon GO and even the long-awaited Pokémon Sleep. Naturally, the landmark event also unveiled new information on upcoming DLC packs. Scarlet and Violet will soon grow with an expansion pack entitled, "The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero".</p><p>The expansion will be released in two parts: The Teal Mask in Fall 2023 and The Indigo Disk in Winter 2023. In The Teal Mask, players will travel to the new land of Kitakami. In The Indigo Disk, your adventure will take you to Blueberry Academy. Naturally, both parts will feature new and returning Pokémon, including new <a href=#>legendaries</a>. The Teal Mask features the masked Grass-type Ogrepon while The Indigo Disk will introduce the mysterious turtle-like Terapagos.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Players can pre-order the expansion now. While the DLC won't come out for a while, you'll still be gifted with new in-game uniforms that you can use to dress your Trainer in the games. As an early-purchase bonus, players will also receive a code that will allow them to obtain a special Hisuian Zoroark that otherwise can't be obtained in the game.</p><p>With DLC expansions officially on the horizon and new Paradox Pokémon already available in the game as of this writing, there's never been a better time to be an aspiring Pokémon master.</p><p>Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet are available on the Nintendo Switch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLatuIytn56qlWKvpnnPqKKepZ%2BjerSvwKujnqxdq7awuMStZJ2kkw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
