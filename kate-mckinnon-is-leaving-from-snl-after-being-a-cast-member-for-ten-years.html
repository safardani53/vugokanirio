Lorne Michaels cast Kate McKinnon on SNL in March 2012. On April 7, 2012, she made her official debut. The actress has been a regular on Saturday Night Live for almost a decade.&nbsp;McKinnon was upgraded to a more permanent place among the recurring cast members in 2013’s Season 39 due to her rapid ascension to fan-favorite performances. Within a year, the New York native was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards for “Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Kate-McKinnon-2.jpg alt="Kate McKinnon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Kate McKinnon has been nominated for an Emmy six times throughout her stint on Saturday Night Live, and she has won the award twice.

While the aforementioned trend was seen in a number of performances, Kate McKinnon memorably broke Ryan Gosling twice during their “Close Encounter” comedy.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Kate-McKinnon-3.jpg alt="Kate McKinnon" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>McKinnon made her skit series debut in 2015 as Colleen Rafferty, supported by Cecily Strong and Ryan Gosling. The three protagonists were being interviewed by the Pentagon about their supposed extraterrestrial abduction. At the time, the Ghostbusters star’s racy recounting of her extraterrestrial abduction story caused Gosling to giggle uncontrollably throughout the play. The same occurred with Gosling and McKinnon in another spoof in the “Close Encounter” series two years later.</p><h2>Fans of Saturday Night Live react to Kate McKinnon’s departure from the program.</h2><p>McKinnon has been a fan favorite cast member of the NBC sitcom, eliciting passionate reactions from viewers.
