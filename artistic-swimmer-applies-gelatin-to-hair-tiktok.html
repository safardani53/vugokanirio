In the video below, she is seen putting a clear glue-like substance in her hair.</p><p>Don’t worry, it’s not gorilla glue. But it also isn't a typical hair care product.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Knox gelatin</a>. Knox is a brand of gelatin like JELL-O, except Knox doesn’t contain any additives and is unflavored. Artistic swimmers often apply it their hair to act like shellac, so all their strands stay fully intact.</p><p>But what is easy to put on, is definitely a struggle to get out.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In the video below, she is seen peeling some of the Knox out, using her comb to almost cut through the hardened, dried gelatin.</p><p>People had lots to say in the comments. In fact, the majority of people overlooked the fact that she wrote that her team got Bronze medals and instead focused on her out-of-the-box hair care process.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"How do you still have hair?" one user asked. Another asked if it was painful to brush her hair after. And one comment just read: No matter how many times I see you do this, I still think it's insane."</p><p>While applying Knox to one's hair looks like it could be a potentially damaging process, Daniella has posted several videos showcasing her natural, healthy curls.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@annadramirez href=#>@annadramirez</a><p>Replying to @tama.van.huffelen The amount of people who think im gonna be bald is BONKERS.
