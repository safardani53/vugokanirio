It was in that house that Bobbi was found unconscious&nbsp;in a bathtub, starting a nearly six-month-long tragedy that has resulted in Bobbi’s deteriorating condition. It makes sense that&nbsp;her aunt reportedly wouldn’t want to keep anything more than she has to. How sad!</p><p class=p1>[jwplatform Q9sixe2V]</p><h3>Bobbi Kristina Deathbed Photo: Brown Family Banned From Room After&nbsp;Leak</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>While Pat takes care of her niece, other members of Bobbi’s family have been reportedly banned from visiting her!
