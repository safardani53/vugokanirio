The family used to live in a poor neighborhood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Amari-Cooper-With-His-Mother-And-Sister.jpg><p>While growing up, Amari dealt with the poverty. Nonetheless, Michelle worked several jobs to support her children solely.&nbsp;</p><h3>Michelle Used To Repair Amari’s Shoes With The Glue</h3><p>As mentioned, Amari had a rough childhood due to the weak financial condition of his family.</p><p>Michelle was a single breadwinner for the family and had insufficient money to buy new shoes for Amari.</p><p>So, Amari used to wear the same shoes for school, playing, and running. And whenever his shoes tore apart, Michelle stuck them with the glue.</p><p>And Amari was happy to play with his friends in those “talking shoes.”</p><h3>Michelle Was So Busy To See Amari Playing</h3><p>Amari was already making a record in his high school. And his mother knew it but could never make time to attend the games.</p><p>While Amari was giving his best performance at school football, Michelle was busy working.&nbsp;</p><p>Back then, the athlete’s mother worked for Royal Caribbean Cruises, Texas Taco Factory Restaurant, and a temp agency.</p><p>Also, Michelle used to earn money by styling hair for her regular customers and neighbors at her home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Amari-Cooper-In-Action.jpg><p>After some time, she earned enough money to buy a truck. Before that, she used to walk alone with the heavy bags.</p><p>All her hard work did not go in vain, as Amari became one of the most successful athletes.</p><p>Moreover, Amari bought her a big home after being drafted into the NFL. Not only this, he gifted Michelle a luxurious Range Rover a year later.</p><h2>Amari Cooper Has Never Seen His Father, Terrance Cooper</h2><p>The wide receiver is not close with his birth father; even Amari has no idea about his appearance.</p><p>His father, Terrance, was jailed in Florida State in 1996. At that time, Amari was not even two years old.</p><p>In May 1996, Terrance was arrested for being involved in a burglary. After that, he was proven to be guilty and a habitual criminal, for which he received 30 years imprisonment.</p><p>So, due to Terrance’s absence from Amari’s life for so long, the athlete never got to know him.</p><p>In his initial days, Amari was sad for not having a father in his life. But, later on, this did not bother him at all.</p><h2>Info On Amari’s Siblings</h2><p>The wide receiver is not the only child of his parents.
