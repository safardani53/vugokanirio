According to reports, Xavi is a fan of the striker and has asked the Barcelona board to bring him in.</p><p><strong>Bounedjah</strong>, based in Qatar, has a strong reputation in the Middle East as a goal scorer. In his first nine appearances, he scored 11 goals and provided three assists. Xavi, who managed the center forward during his two-year stint in Qatar, will know how to get the most out of a player who won the Golden Boot last season.</p><p>However, the step up to a club of Barcelona’s caliber may be too much for a player who has never played in a major European league. At the club, Luuk de Jong and Philippe Coutinho are already considered surplus to requirements. A risky transfer for an untested player would be difficult for the club.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/xa.jpg alt=xavi width=650 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Bounedjah’s prime years are behind him at the age of 29. The Blaugrana might be better off following up on the slew of forwards they’ve been linked with across Europe in recent weeks. Karim Adeyemi of Red Bull Salzburg and Raheem Sterling of Manchester City are among them.</p><p>Barcelona has lost Lionel Messi, Antoine Griezmann, and Francisco Trincao in the recent transfer window.</p><p>Ronald Koeman’s administration signed Sevilla loanee Luuk de Jong to compete with Martin Braithwaite for Barcelona’s starting spot. The two previously enjoyed working with the Dutch national team, but his signing has been a flop for Barcelona.</p><p>Xavi Hernandez is unlikely to play de Jong, especially after failing to make an appearance under Sergi Barjuan. With Sergio Aguero out for the foreseeable future, Barcelona must sign a striker during the winter transfer window. Bounedjah may not be the best option, but with the club’s financial resources dwindling, they may not have many other options.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGivmq6ZYr%2BmvdSeqq2rXZeus6%2FEpaanmV2pvG6%2FyKClZqulp72ztdKipaBlpJa%2FqLHTaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
