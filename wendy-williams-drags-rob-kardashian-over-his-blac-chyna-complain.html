Or that’s what his lawyers are reportedly going to argue in yet another court battle to amend the custody agreement.
Wendy Williams, as you’ll see in the clip below, thinks that this is hogwash and that Rob should just accept that he’s lost and that Chyna won."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That said, it’s hard to see a realistic way that his weight, even in the past, would impact his ability to care for his daughter)</p><p>She also suggests that Rob might need a woman — such as one of his maternally experienced sisters or his mother — to tell him what to do in order to be the best parent for Dream.</p><p>That … is something that fewer people find objectionable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Wendy gets into the six-month rule that Rob is rumored to be pushing to impose upon Chyna.</p><p>"Their relationships only last for six months," she exclaims.</p><p>She says that she likes that for more "normal" couples, in Hollywood or beyond. That seems like a common-sense policy, to keep children from growing attached to a carousel of short-term partners.</p><p>"That’s what decent people do," Wendy continues.</p><p>After a pause, she follows that up with: "I’m not saying that Rob and Chyna aren’t decent."</p><p>Isn’t she, though?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Wendy then slams Rob for having hooked up with a stripper in the first place, and for her lacking a backbone.</p><p>In fact, it doesn’t seem that Wendy has a very high opinion of sex workers of any kind, which is sad. That’s a stigma that needs to end.</p><p>"You are stuck, Rob," Wendy says to the camera. "You are stuck with a stripper who is running circles around you."</p><p>Honestly, like many people, Wendy sounds impressed by how Chyna is perceived to have used Rob Kardashian.</p><p>"You know what? Chyna … you’re still winning. She’s still winning."</p><p>It’s possible that her winning streak will end in court after her Six Flags outburst, but that remains to be seen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Wendy also lays into Rob’s sock line, talking about how expensive each pair of socks is and how she imagines that they would sell better under a couple of situations.</p><p>One, if Rob were to lower the price to, you know, a level that a person would be willing to pay for the novelty of Kardashian socks.</p><p>Two, if Rob were more like "the old Rob" (we think that she just means if he shed his excess weight), and stopped dressing like a "slob," as she terms it.</p><p>Specifically, Wendy says: "Nobody wants a sock after this slob!"</p><p>As unfair as it may sound that Rob needs to dress nicely and improve public perception if he wants his socks to sell better, that is usually how a personal brand of clothing works.</p><p>But a man of Rob’s means can probably afford to get nice suits tailored to him, at any size.</p><p>And if Rob’s having trouble budgeting it, we’re sure that any of his sisters and certainly his mother would be thrilled to help him visit a tailor and tidy up his look.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY6voJ2dn6h8uLHNnbBmr5mhuaqtzKxknaqRnMBuvs6bZKSZopmutLTImqVmp6aav260yKxkm6SRmHqktNinmGabn6K9ra3Ip2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
