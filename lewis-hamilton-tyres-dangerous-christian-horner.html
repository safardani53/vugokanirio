Hamilton had qualified on pole, but received a ten-place grid penalty as punishment for his fourth engine change of the season, when drivers are only permitted three."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We shouldn’t have come in. I told you.”</p><p>When asked by Sky Sports whether he thought his tyres could have lasted the whole race, Hamilton said: “[Esteban] Ocon’s did, I heard, so I assume they probably could.</p><p>“The tyres are bald so you don’t know how far they will go, so there’s definitely a little worry of the life of the tyres.</p><p>“But also, I wasn’t really that fast at the end there. I was struggling, had low grip, not really sure why, but then all of a sudden I’d have not such bad pace. But I was losing performance to the guys behind.</p><p>“I think probably in hindsight I should have stayed out or come in much earlier because when you come in with eight laps to go you don’t have time to go through the graining phase of that medium (intermediate) tyre on a drying track, so then I went through this whole sliding phase where I nearly lost more positions.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-11-at-11.04.22.png><p>Mercedes boss Toto Wolff also suggested that Hamilton should have pitted earlier and that Hamilton's insistence not to may have cost him a podium finish.</p><p>Wolff told&nbsp;Sky Sports: “The intermediate obviously looked really scary, but we thought that we could maybe hang out there and finish third with not stopping.</p><p>“Or if a dry line appears maybe going on to a soft tyre until the end.</p><p>“So we balanced between pitting, taking it very conservative, fighting with Leclerc and Perez on the track for P3, or taking a little bit of a gamble and either winning or finishing third.</p><p>“Then we saw Leclerc dropping off and Lewis started dropping off and it was clear that we wouldn’t make it to the end.</p><p>“It was clear that if we stayed out he would have lost against (Pierre) Gasly in any case. I think that he in the car still felt good, but he was one-and-a-half seconds off the pace and would have anyway lost the position.</p><p>“And on the other side it is always frustrating that you see the other cars, you haven’t actually passed them, they are out on track in front of you.</p><p>“The correct call would have probably been taking it very conservative and pitting when everybody pitted for the intermediate, coming out behind Perez, probably behind Leclerc and then fighting with them on-track for P3.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/JW-F1-2021-SEASON-CAL-SEPT30-v3.jpg><p class=has-text-align-center>🏁<strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">F1 2021 calendar: practice times, dates</a> and racetrack info</strong></p><p>“DNFing and losing all the points, that’s obviously catastrophic.
