Everybody else knows what is going on but they don’t do anything.&nbsp;</p><p>“The problem is that this is where the violence comes from.”</p><p>Yaadgaar is located next to a furniture shop called BJ’s Bargains with sofas for sale outside.</p><p>There dishevelled drinkers take advantage of the comfy seats and sink cans at all times of the day.</p><p>But, Shah said, they “don’t cause any problems really.

Locals tell us he’s been there nearly 12 months.</p><p>Shop worker Kevin McHale, 60, is out walking his dog Betty in the park when he tells us about the problems.</p><p>“It is like London here,” he said. “You expect to hear news of stabbings and crime in a big city, but this shouldn’t be happening in a small suburb of Leeds. It’s terrible.</p><p>“I am not shocked to hear about stabbings and gangs with machetes anymore because they are an everyday occurrence around here.</p><p>“I often come home at 9pm after finishing work at Smyth’s and it is busier at night than it is during the day.”</p><p>William Rigby, 63, is a self-employed builder and he has lived in the area for 30 years.&nbsp;</p><p>He said: “I was broken into when I was first moving in, it was when it was empty.&nbsp;</p><p>“I put metal grilles on the doors and windows after that and I’ve not been broken into since.

I set up all that security after I got a motorbike and got it nicked, so it won’t happen to me again.</p><p>“I have five deadlocks on my door so that I can lock up at night and feel completely safe as I sleep. Nobody is getting in here.”</p><p>But despite having to take drastic measures to protect his home, William says he “doesn’t mind” the area.</p><p>“I don’t really pay attention to what's going on around me,” he admits. “I live in my own little world with my wife and we lock that door and get on with our lives.”</p><p>The area does have its good points; it is a wonderful cultural mix of ethnicities that creates a feeling of acceptance and diversity.</p><p>Its two main shopping streets, on Harehills Land and Harehills Road, encompass a vast range of home and clothing retail along with food outlets, charity hubs and solicitors, to name a few.&nbsp;</p><p>Abdulrahim Othman, 49, has just opened a business selling appliances and furniture in an old garage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gv-s-harehills-area-leeds-863166561.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gv-s-harehills-area-leeds-863166062.jpg><p>He said he knows nothing about the recent stabbing, having only just opened in the area, but added: “I know there are a lot of drugs and drink here, but it is a good place for business.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is very busy with a lot of customers. They don’t have a lot of money so they always want to buy things as cheap as possible and sometimes have to pay for things a bit at a time, but I have a lot of customers.”</p><p>Earlier this year a shopkeeper, Shahid Gohar, who ran Gohar Discount Shop on Harehills Lane, told how he would give away loaves of bread to needy families who were struggling in the cost of living crisis.</p><p>But when we went to speak to him his shop was shuttered up.</p><p>Naz Rashid, 40, who works in sales and repairs at Gas and Electrical World next door on Harehills Lane, told us his neighbour had had to close because he couldn’t make ends meet and now works as an <a href=#>Uber</a> driver.</p><p>Naz said he doesn’t think Harehills deserves the reputation it has.&nbsp;</p><p>“I grew up here and had a great childhood, playing marbles and cricket on the streets, but there were no cars then,” he told us.</p><p>“Now you can’t even get a parking space. There are a lot of families who live here who just want to get on with their lives.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s the drugs that cause the problem. There is a lot of drug dealing and it happens completely out in the open.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gv-s-harehills-area-leeds-863166336-1.jpg><p>Owner of RS Minimarket, Shailendra Bhagal, 48, was angry to be turned down when he applied to extend his licence so he could sell alcohol at 8am in the morning.</p><p>At the moment he opens at 11am but worries if he opens earlier he will get trouble from locals who demand he sells them alcohol when he is not allowed.</p><p>“They refused my licence,” he said, “which I don’t understand why, they said it was because of a problem with alcohol in the area but the post office and an off licence further down the road sell it so I don’t see what difference it makes.&nbsp;</p><p>“So many people have asked me if I will open early but I don’t feel I can unless I have a licence.”</p><p>A former clergyman, who did not wish to give his name, moved to the outskirts of Harehills to retire when he retired in 2012.</p><p>Despite being burgled and having cars vandalised, he doesn’t believe it deserves its bad reputation.</p><p>“We love the diversity of culture,” he said. “Yes it does have its problems but I like to remain upbeat about it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gv-s-harehills-area-leeds-863165909.jpg><p>Inspector Alastair Nicholls, who heads the Leeds East Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: “We recognise there are concerns about the issue of drug dealing in the Harehills area and are tackling this and other existing issues in the area through the CommUnity Harehills project.&nbsp;</p><p>“This ongoing project sees our officers work with partner agencies and the community to target organised criminal activity and put measures in place to build resilience so it is less susceptible to other criminal groups by using the Home Office’s ‘Clear Hold Build’ tactic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“These operations are aimed at improving local people’s confidence and trust in the police and partner agencies by delivering a whole-system approach to improve the local community.&nbsp;</p><p>“The issue of drug dealing is taken seriously and anyone with concerns about this is asked to contact their local NPT so these concerns can be investigated and acted upon.”&nbsp;</p><p>A spokesperson for Leeds City Council said: “No one should have to put up with anti-social or criminal behaviour, and through our Safer Leeds partnership, the council works closely with West Yorkshire Police and members of the community in Harehills to address any concerns around anti-social behaviour and wider crime issues.</p><p>“We recognise the impact crime and anti-social behaviour can have on communities and through this partnership work, we look towards longer-term solutions which make our communities safer and deter those involved.</p><p>“Enforcement tools that are available to the council include court injunctions banning people from engaging in certain types of behaviour, premises closure orders and, in cases that involve a person who is a council tenant, taking action related to their tenancy.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“We would ask anyone who is experiencing crime or anti-social behaviour in the area to please contact the police or the council’s dedicated anti-social behaviour team as soon as possible.</p><p>“Residents can be assured that all cases will be investigated in a thorough and confidential manner.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/gv-s-harehills-area-leeds-863165551.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4F6fpBxanFnnZawqbHTnmSgmZ6cwG6%2F1Jusq5pdmL%2BqucRmm6utl6h6qa3Rnp%2BipJyoeq2xxJ2qaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
