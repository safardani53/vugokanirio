He let us in – he’d just come from upstairs," Laptew says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/f13357e1-bf67-40a7-8648-22fc74888f95.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-16-at-08.07.51.png><p>“And I said to him: ‘Peter, do you frequent prostitutes?”</p><p>Laptew says Sutcliffe replied: “No, not at all, I’ve no need – I’m only recently married."</p><p>At the time, the police believed the Ripper was motivated by a hatred of sex workers – an assumption in the investigation that led to the disastrous dismissal of evidence from attacks on women and girls not involved in sex work.</p><p>Despite Sutcliffe's seemingly innocent answers, Laptew's suspicions were raised by certain clues he noticed during the interview.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NINTCHDBPICT000285011040.jpg><p>“His shoe size was an eight-and-a-half, which was very similar to the shoe size of the offender," Laptew says.</p><p>“And I noticed that one of the boots was quite worn on the right-hand sole, which was a point made out on the tracks that’d been left, the footprints.”</p><p>Most damning of all was the resemblance between Sutcliffe and a photofit made by police after 25-year-old Marilyn Moore was attacked by a man believed to be the Ripper in 1977.</p><h2>'That was it - forgotten'</h2><p>Laptew left Sutcliffe's house telling him that he might need to speak with him again – he was confident something wasn't right.</p><p>But in the documentary, he recalls the catastrophic mistake bosses made when he delivered his report on Sutcliffe.</p><p>“I got the report typed up and took it to the boss’ office and explained all the things that were bugging me," Laptew says.</p><p>“I said: 'The most startling thing is the Marilyn Moore photofit'.
