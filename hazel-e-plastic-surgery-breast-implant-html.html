On October 12, 2021, the rapper's husband De’Von Waller took to his Instagram to announce that Hazel-E would be getting another plastic surgery — precisely breast implants — very soon.

In addition, the&nbsp;surgery package was a gift from him to her for their second wedding anniversary. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"@hazelebaby pack your bags!" Waller wrote in his caption. "The flights are booked recovery villa @plastiquespahouse is locked in for your surgical revision @305plastic_surgery with @drjulioclavijo_plasticsurgery . Thank you @surgery411gangmain for organizing every detail of this revision for my wife."</p><p>The post included a clip and a note where he also explained how he came across the idea of gifting her a plastic surgery package. He first wrote that&nbsp;he had vowed always to have her back two years ago and that there was nothing he wouldn't do for their family.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He continued to add that despite their good relationship, the couple went through a lot with him especially seeing her overcome the problems graciously and come out even stronger. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In between those thoughts, he sought the best gift he could give to his wife, and in the end, he ended up choosing a recovery plastic surgery, led by proven surgeons, so that her bad breast implants get fixed.</p><p>"You deserve the world baby. I love you," he added, concluding his text.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Hazel-E and Fans' Reactions</h2><p>Impressed with his effort,&nbsp;Hazel-E dropped an emotional comment on his post, writing, "I love you. I just can't even take this all in!" <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"Awee. This is actually sweet guys lol. Ya know hazel got her body messed up in turkey and almost died. The fact that he knows that this is what would make her happy and hes doing it for her is so sweet," someone&nbsp;commented, admiring the couple's supportive nature towards each other.</p><p>The post, where only a limited number of people were allowed to comment, also received numerous other messages from the couple's close friends and followers.</p><h2>What Happened in&nbsp;Turkey?</h2><p>After getting married to her husband Waller in October 2019, and subsequently, welcoming their first baby in June 2020, the family traveled to Turkey in early 2021 to get&nbsp;Hazel-E a "Mommy Makeover." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The <a href=# rel=follow>Love And Hip Hop</a>&nbsp;reality star opened up about her experience through her Instagram stories in April and claimed that her family was&nbsp;traumatized during their trip and they were&nbsp;canceling all travel plans until further notice.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"I've got to get my daughter and I back on track, we are both sick as dogs. Give DeVon a mental, physical break," she added.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In another story, she revealed that she wanted her old body back after giving birth to her daughter; hence, she traveled abroad and performed plastic surgery on her body. That said, the surgery was badly done, so much so that she reportedly wasn't able to walk for weeks.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Now, the couple must be hoping for a successful surgery and&nbsp;Hazel-E to get fit and healthy. We, too, wish the best for&nbsp;Hazel-E and the family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKCRr7KtecRmp6WZo6m2pHnSrqmgnaKueqO%2BxJqqrWWZor2trc2tZaGsnaE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
