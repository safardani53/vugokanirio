There are four iPhone models this year. Two are cheaper: iPhone 14 and 14 Plus. Two are pricier and more powerful: iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.
The iPhone 14 is the cheapest of the lot, but make no mistake – it’s still a high-end blower."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Two are cheaper: iPhone 14 and 14 Plus. Two are pricier and more powerful: <a href=#>iPhone 14 Pro</a> and iPhone 14 Pro Max.</p><p>The iPhone 14 is the cheapest of the lot, but make no mistake – it’s still a high-end blower.</p><p>It’s got the same tried-and-tested square-edge design introduced with the <a href=#>iPhone 12</a>.</p><p>You’ve got a nice selection of <a href=#>colours</a> to choose from, although they are all slightly muted.</p><p>Blue and Purple are quite pale, Midnight is dark and very pretty, Starlight is an attractive off-white, and Red is the brightest and boldest of the bunch.</p><p>They’re all nice safe colours. I’ve been using blue – very similar to last year’s <a href=#>iPhone 13 Pro</a>, to my eyes.</p><p>Speaking of borrowed features, the iPhone 14 is using 2021's A15 Bionic chip. Again, that’s borrowed from the 13 Pro.</p><p>It’s a blisteringly fast processor with improved graphics performance thanks to a 5-core GPU. That means mobile <a href=#>gaming</a> is very smooth for a <a href=#>smartphone</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Phones & Gadgets</h2></p><p>A more powerful A16 processor is reserved for the iPhone 14 Pro only this year, sadly.</p><p>The iPhone 14 ships with a very bright and colourful Super Retina XDR <a href=#>OLED display</a>.</p><p>What does that mean? The first bit is <a href=#>Apple</a> marketing jargon, but simply means it’s a pixel-dense screen with high contract, good brightness and a wide range of colours.</p><p>And an OLED display has pixels that illuminate themselves rather than requiring a backlight – so parts of the screen can be turned off to display true black.</p><p>It’s a good size at 6.1 inches, although the larger 6.7-inch Plus might take your fancy when it’s out.</p><p>For comparison, these screen sizes mirror the more powerful iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.</p><p>If you’re worried about keeping the screen safe, you’ll be glad to know there’s a Ceramic Shield covering on the front to protect the display.</p><p>The iPhone 14 is also water-resistant too, so don’t worry about getting it a little wet.</p><h2>Safety first</h2><p>And don’t forget: the iPhone 14 can keep *you* safe too.</p><p>There are two new features built for life-preservation.</p><p>In some ways, they're the two best things about the new iPhone.</p><p>Sadly they proved problematic because (for soon-to-be-obvious reasons) I couldn't actually test them.</p><p>The first is car-crash detection, which uses sensors inside your iPhone to register when you’ve been in a severe motoring accident.</p><p>If you’re unresponsive for 10 seconds or more, the iPhone 14 can share your location with emergency services – and even alert your emergency contacts.</p><p>The second is emergency SOS satellite calling.</p><p>This lets you link up with satellites when you’re in a very rural area but need emergency help.</p><p>You can request an emergency response in a situation where you’d normally be unable to contact anyone.</p><p>If you’re not in the middle of nowhere, you’ll be glad to hear that the iPhone 14 supports speedy <a href=#>5G internet</a>. You’ll need a 5G SIM and signal, of course.</p><p>Apple is promising a massive 20 hours of video playback in the iPhone 14, which is a great testament to its battery life.</p><p>In my own use, it comfortably lasted a full day. If you’re very careful, you could probably get close to two days of usage.</p><h2>Snap happy</h2><p>There’s a new main camera (and some improved image processing) that will net you much better lowlight photos.</p><p>I’ve been very pleased with the quality even in very dim settings.</p><p>You can record very impressive video in <a href=#>4K</a> at 24fps, and there’s also a new camera mode for ultra-stabilised footage.</p><p>It’s called Action Mode and uses some clever camera tricks to avoid shaking, rocking and bouncing video.</p><p>I tried it while running in a very elaborate way (filming a subject that was also running) and it worked fantastically. It was like I was using a physical stabiliser. Mind-blowing!</p><p>The selfie camera is also improved, with better photos captured in low-light.</p><p>Just be mindful when you’re snapping drunken selfies at night – they might capture more detail than you’d like.</p><h2>I-LOVE!</h2><p>Last but not least, every iPhone 14 comes running Apple’s new <a href=#>iOS 16</a> as standard.</p><p>It lets you personalise your iPhone like never before, including a <a href=#>highly customisable Lock Screen</a> to really make it your own.</p><p>You can also edit and unsend iMessages and pin Safari tabs.</p><p>Of course you can get the new <a href=#>iOS</a> on an iPhone 8 or later, so you don’t need the latest model for this.</p><p>The iPhone 14 has less going for it than the iPhone 14 Pro.</p><p>But then again it’s £250/$200 cheaper at £849/$799, so that’s not exactly a surprise.</p><p>And even though it doesn’t have the flashy design of the new Pro model, it still looks brilliant – and has cracking performance to boot.</p><p>Sadly the UK price hike (of £50) will bite Brits, but there’s no increased cost for Americans versus last year.</p><p>And ultimately, this is still a high-end machine that outperforms almost all rivals.</p><p>If price is an issue (and it may be, with the ongoing cost of living crisis) then you should absolutely consider cheaper iPhone options.</p><p>Apple is still flogging the exceptional <a href=#>iPhone 13</a> and still-performant iPhone 12.</p><p>And for those on a very tight budget, there’s the £449/$429 <a href=#>iPhone SE</a>.</p><p>We've got the best contracts from networks listed on our <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone 14 pre-orders</a> page.</p><p><strong>The Sun says:</strong> Great value for money and generally brilliant, the iPhone 14 is the perfect model for someone who needs an easy upgrade. <strong>5/5</strong></p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>All prices in this article were correct at the time of writing, but may have since changed.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>Always do your own research before making any purchase.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/003.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/004.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/002.jpg><p>The iPhone 14 is available on Friday, September 16 for £849/$799.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Best Phone and Gadget tips and hacks</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000729743678.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Looking for tips and hacks for your phone?
