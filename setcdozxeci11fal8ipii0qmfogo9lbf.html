"I'm very excited because I have a new single coming out. It’s going to be the first single on my first album, it's called "One Good Move." It's coming out March 3rd. I'm announcing that here, I haven't announced that anywhere else." Esten goes on to reveal what's in store for his character in the upcoming season of "Outer Banks." "Ward has had a hard time of it because he's made some poor decisions...But here we are in the third season, and what I love about it, it's a little bit of a morality play because Ward ends up after season two with all the gold, all the treasure. And really, he sort of has nothing in his life. And meanwhile, those Pogues, these kids that he's battling with, they have nothing, they are on a deserted island, but they have each other, so they have everything...in season three you see Ward going alright, none of this meant anything. Is that going to change him? Is he going to have a turn of heart or is he going to revert to his old self? It's just been a thrill to play."<p>STREAMING WEEKDAYS</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sa3RmqSorZ6pva3B0meaqKVfqLWww9JoraKclaR8tLGzfHuIkoh6kIp9kH%2BYhXCZhZaqfLCGfaiff26Zo5KO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
