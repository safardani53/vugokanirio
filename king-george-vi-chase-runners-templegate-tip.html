He is out of the top drawer and won back-to-back Ryanairs at Cheltenham before injury stopped him surely landing the hat-trick this year. That 2m5f trip is clearly his best but he’s a Grade 1 winner over three miles too. He can jump a little to the left, which isn’t ideal at Kempton, but he looked well winning from almost two years off at Clonmel and has every chance of giving Mullins a third King George.</p><p>BRAVEMANSGAME<br>GAME on! He won this last year by 14 lengths before running a cracking second in the Cheltenham Gold Cup when the 3m2f and finishing hill were just a bit too much. He has not been quite as his best this season but, as Paul Nicholls says, this is very much a home match for him — and it’s his cup final too. Going back right-handed on a speed track is a major plus and the British champ is desperate to strike. He goes on any ground and can defend his crown.</p><p>FRODON<br>TO and Fro. Paul Nicholls’ veteran has a good record in this race, winning in 2010, finishing fourth in 2021 and third 12 months ago. He’s 11 now and his effort in the Badger Beer Chase at Wincanton last time was a little short of his usual but he wasn’t given a hard race. Bryony Frost will get him jumping out in front but it’s hard to see him holding off his younger rivals.</p><p>HEWICK<br>ON my Wick. He’s been a great servant to eccentric trainer Shark Hanlon, winning the 2022 Galway Plate, Bet365 Gold Cup and the American Grand National. He ran well in March’s Cheltenham Gold Cup until falling two out and was poor when trying to defend his Galway crown. This is one of the stiffest tests of his career despite the likely good ground being ideal.</p><p>SHISHKIN<br>KIN the running. He’s become an enigma, wrapped in a conundrum inside a puzzle with the cherry on top being his refusal to even start at Ascot last month. Nicky Henderson is adamant he has his head right and that makes him dangerous. The six-times Grade 1 winner spent most of his career over shorter trips — winning races like the Arkle. But he ran as well as ever stepped up to 3m1f to win the Aintree Bowl and a repeat of that would give him a chance.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Horse Racing</h2></p><p>THE REAL WHACKER<br>WHACK may crack. He took a big step forward last season, winning the Dipper at Cheltenham on New Year’s Day before returning to hold off Gerri Colombe when taking the Brown Advisory at the Festival. He was clearly coming to the end of his tether over 3m up the hill and he’ll get home easier at this flatter track. He comes here after being pulled up on comeback at Cheltenham latest when he was beaten a long way out and came home lame.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Templegate's King George tip</h2><p>BRAVEMANSGAME was brilliant when winning this by 14 lengths last year and can get his mojo back at his favourite track.</p><p>Things haven’t gone quite to plan this season but this has always been his big day and Paul Nicholls will have him spot on.</p><p>He’ll need to be with Willie Mullins throwing Allaho into the fray.</p><p>He’s best known for his Ryanair exploits but has winning form over this longer trip and is dangerous.</p><p>And don’t forget Shishkin. If he jumps off with the others, his best form would take him mighty close.</p><h4 class=has-text-align-center id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here><a href=# aria-label="FREE BETS - GET THE BEST SIGN UP DEALS AND RACING OFFERS (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FREE BETS - GET THE BEST SIGN UP DEALS AND RACING OFFERS</a></h4><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
