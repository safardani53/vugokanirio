Leah Remini claimed that Scientology got in the way of Tom Cruise‘s marriage to Katie Holmes, weeks after slamming the actor’s “good guy” image.
“Scientology considers Katie a suppressive person which is an enemy,” Remini, 50, told the New York Post on Wednesday, August 12. “I knew Katie when she was in [Scientology] and she seemed very indoctrinated into Tom’s world, but as time went on, I understood why she did what she did to protect her daughter."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Earlier this year, the Dawson’s Creek alum reflected on <a href=#>the “intense” adjustment to becoming a single mother</a> following her divorce.</p><p>“It was a lot of attention, and I had a little child on top of it,” she told InStyle in her April 2020 cover story, adding that there were several moments where she “actually cried” from being so overwhelmed.</p><p>Remini, who <a href=#>left the Church of Scientology behind</a> in 2013, told the New York Post that she was “really proud” of Holmes for taking a stand against a situation that could have become “very toxic and dangerous” for her family. Two weeks earlier, the King of Queens alum <a href=#>put Cruise on blast for the “manipulated” image</a> that he’s developed through his association with the organization.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Leah-Remini-Believes-Tom-Cruise-Indoctrinated-Ex-Wife-Katie-Holmes-into-Scientology-During-Their-Marriage-02.jpg><p>“I think it’s time for people to start waking up to the real facts here. Tom has for years manipulated his image to be the good guy,” she said in a statement to Us Weekly on July 27. “Although I believe there was a time when Tom was a decent and kindhearted person, he has morphed himself into <strong>David Miscavige</strong> [leader of Scientology] and is completely dedicated to Scientology’s mission to ‘clear’ planet Earth — which means making 80 percent of the world’s population into Scientologists.”</p><p>The New York native has been outspoken against the Church of Scientology since her departure, even creating an Emmy-winning series, <a href=#>Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath</a>, to expose some of the organization’s alleged scandals. In July 2019, Us confirmed that <a href=#>Remini was “considering taking legal action” against the Church</a> after claiming that she had been “spied on and followed” by its members. (A spokesperson for the Church of Scientology denied Remini’s accusations at the time.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While speaking to the Daily Beast in July, the former Kevin Can Wait actress doubled down on her critiques of Cruise, asserting that <a href=#>his actions aren’t “consistent”</a> with the positive persona he presents to the public.</p><p>“Tom has gotten away with being this ‘nice guy,’ because that’s what Scientology policy says — <a href=#>to create good PR</a> in the world and make those ‘good actions’ known,” she said at the time. “That this guy can be running around and having people think he’s this super-nice guy, I don’t get it. But that’s the Hollywood bulls–t game people play.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalnZGderOxzKKlomWkpLpur9GuoKydXZ67pbvCramippGpsqV5ypqrop1dnbytucSsZKKmpKR6tK%2FInqWtp5yktLp7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
