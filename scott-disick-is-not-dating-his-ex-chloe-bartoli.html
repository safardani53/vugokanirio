Disick, 40, and Bartoli, 33, were photographed smiling and enjoying each other’s company while spending time on the beach and in the ocean on December 27, 2023.</p><p>During the outing, Disick rocked green swim trunks, a tan T-shirt and gold necklaces during the tropical outing, while Bartoli wore a black crocheted cover up over a pink bikini. She accessorized her ensemble with aviator sunglasses and silver and gold jewelry.</p><p>The insider went on to note that “Scott is doing really well” at the moment. “He’s a very involved and great dad, he and <strong>Kourtney</strong> [<strong>Kardashian</strong>]’s relationship has improved as well.”</p><p>Disick was connected to Bartoli the same year he and Kardashian, 44, <a href=#>began dating</a> in 2006. The reality stars went on to date for nearly decade and welcomed <a href=#>three children</a>, Mason, 14, Penelope, 11, and Reign, 9, before <a href=#>calling it quits</a> in July 2015. Bartoli was accused of playing a part in their breakup as Kardashian ended things after Disick was spotted <a href=#>cozying up to her</a> in Monte Carlo.</p><p>“There was no trying to hide how handsy they were,” an eyewitness told Us at the time. “They were all over each other and so blatant. They were feeding each other with their own forks. She was nuzzling her head on his shoulder and he was stroking her arms and thighs.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Scott-Disick-Is-Not-Dating-Ex-Chloe-Bartoli-Despite-Recent-Hangout--e1704398773330.jpg><p>The two have worked on their <a href=#>coparenting relationship</a> as Disick continues to appear on on the Kardashian-Jenner family’s Hulu series, The Kardashians. Kardashian moved on with <strong>Travis Barker</strong>, <a href=#>tying the knot</a> in May 2022. The couple <a href=#>welcomed their son</a>, Rocky, in November 2023.</p><p>Following the split from Kardashian, Disick started dating <strong>Sofia Richie</strong> — who also has ties to Bartoli. “After Sofia started hooking up with Scott, Chloe stopped speaking to her. It’s a mess,” another source exclusively told <a href=#>Us</a> in September 2017. “They were the best of friends and were inseparable.”</p><p>Bartoli later clarified to <a href=#>Us</a> that there was “no bad blood” between her and Richie, 25. “Me and Sofia are cool,” she revealed in June 2018. Disick and Richie continued to date on and off through August 2020.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Disick, went on to spark romances with <strong>Amelia Hamlin</strong>, <strong>Rebecca Donaldson</strong> and <strong>Kimberly Stewart</strong>. During an October 2023 episode of The Kardashians, Penelope hilariously <a href=#>called out her father</a> for dating women much younger than him.</p><p>“[She should be] older. 20s? You’re 40! You’re not going to date someone 19,” she stated while discussing Disick’s love life with her grandmother <strong>Kris Jenner</strong> and aunt <strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong>. “A good personality. She can be pretty. Someone who goes to the gym because you need to go to the gym.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasm5%2BpwW6wyKygnKNdnsBuus6tZJ2ZpJ67qHnHoqpmnahisKm4zp5km5miqbyttY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
