Martin and Stringfield welcomed a child a few years later, but have still managed to keep the details of their relationship under wraps. Even their wedding was a surprise for both their guests and the press.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Martin previously told PEOPLE that meeting Stringfield was “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>an important episode</a>” in his life. “She makes it all possible. She has one of the most important qualities a person can have, and that’s kindness,” he added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So who is Steve Martin’s wife?

During her time as a fact-checker, Stringfield was asked to check one of Martin’s comedy pieces and the rest was history.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We talked on the phone for a year before we even met," Martin told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>AARP</a> in 2017.

Approximately 75 guests were in attendance and former Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey, who is also a friend of Martin’s, officiated the ceremony.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Martin’s publicist Alan Nierob, there was a star-studded guest list that included <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Eugene Levy</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Tom Hanks</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Diane Keaton</a>.

During the ceremony, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Tina Fey</a> — who is a longtime friend of Martin’s — commented on the similarities between Stringfield and herself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Martin married “a woman who is, I think a younger, thinner, smarter version of me,” Fey said. To which the actor responded, “She does look like my wife!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In fact, Stringfield even made a cameo in season 2 of Only Murders in the Building as a lookalike of Fey's character Cinda Canning.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-martin-are-avid-art-collectors></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She and Martin are avid art collectors&nbsp;</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Stefanie Keenan/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Martin and Stringfield lent works of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Aboriginal Australian art</a> from their personal collection to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Larry Gagosian</a>’s Madison Avenue gallery in New York City in 2019.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I never talk about our art collection, because it’s our private sanctuary, but I am so enthused about the Indigenous art,” Martin told Australia’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>ABC</a> that year. “There is no doubt these [desert paintings] hang well with others and that one day they will be in the company of great contemporary art at auction and not culled out as a special field.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-martin-welcomed-a-baby-in-2012></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She and Martin welcomed a baby in 2012&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Cheaper by the Dozen star may be known for his role as a fun-loving on-screen father, but it wasn’t until 2012 that he and Stringfield had a child of their own.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A year after their daughter’s birth, Martin gave an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>emotional speech</a> about becoming a first-time father at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Governors Awards. "My wife alone would have been enough reward for my life … but now she's brought me a wonderful child,” he told the audience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2017, Martin spoke with AARP about parenting a young child at 71 years old, calling it “fantastic.” He added, "I think if I'd had a child earlier, I would have been a lousy father because I would have misplaced my attention on my career. I am very forthcoming with her, and it's great. She's giving me way more than I'm giving her."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shes-never-walked-the-red-carpet-with-martin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She’s never walked the red carpet with Martin</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Michael Buckner/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite Martin’s fame, he and Stringfield prefer to keep their personal life private. In fact, in 1990 Martin told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Oklahoman</a> that he wasn’t a fan of interviews. "I don't really have a tabloid life," Martin said. "I really don't like to talk about it [his personal life]. I think most people are this way.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2015, he also admitted that his wife also prefers to stay out of the spotlight and has “never walked a red carpet.” She has accompanied her husband to a few industry events, however, including the Vanity Fair Oscar Party in 2013 and 2015. Most recently, the couple attended the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>American Museum Of Natural History Gala</a> in November 2021, where they were seated with musician <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Dave Grohl</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Lorne Michaels</a>.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6edvG610maYp6aVYsC1vsinnp%2BhlaGxbr%2FTnq2eZZ2Wv7W1zWauop6VYoR2gpVsam0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
