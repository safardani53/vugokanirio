Absolutely. With the way she dressed, the way she acted, everything was sex related and encouraged by people around her.</p><p>"Who in their right mind thinks 'Ah she's just turned 18 so now it's time to make money on OnlyFans', you don't think of that in a few days there must have been some preparation when she was under 18.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on Bhad Bhabie">Read more on Bhad Bhabie</h2><p>"It's not normal to pay to see a barely legal girl explicitly. The sad thing is they treat her like a product. Everyone around her just wants her to make money.</p><p>"She doesn't rap anymore, she doesn't sing, she doesn't go on tour.</p><p>"She sits in her house and she does her OnlyFans. I don't know how many hours a day they are telling her to do it but to make that kind of money must be time consuming. I know there's a leaked video of her with a bunch of girls doing sexual things.</p><h2 id=it-was-planned>'IT WAS PLANNED'</h2><p>"You don't just come with an idea like that and all of a sudden generate that amount of people and that amount of money, you have to prepare, it is pre planned."</p><p>The Florida native shot to fame on an episode of <a href=#>Dr Phil</a> in 2016, aged 13, after being brought on the show by mom Barbara Ann who was struggling to keep the <a href=#>unruly teen under control.</a></p><p>While her life was laid bare on camera, Danielle became annoyed at the audience members who were laughing at her.</p><p>Turning to threats, Danielle asked the audience: "Catch me outside, how about that?"</p><p>But, because of her accent, it sounded a lot more like: "Cash me ousside, how bow dah?"</p><h2 id=making-millions>MAKING MILLIONS</h2><p>The slogan went viral and Danielle was soon signed up by management agencies and given a record deal.</p><p>On Monday, the rapper shared a screenshot of her OnlyFans account listing her monthly earnings from the first year of her account, stating her total gross income was a huge $53m and the net income $42.3m.</p><p>She posted the screenshot on Instagram with the comment: "Go cry about it b***h."</p><p>Ira is dubious of the claims, which he believes may be over-inflated.</p><p>Ira said: "I do believe she is making a decent amount of money for sure, but I never believe the amount people say - in my opinion it's bloated. I believe $50 million is very far fetched.</p><p>"But if they are making $50 million why the hell are they bragging about it? I hope they are paying taxes because that's a sure fire way of getting the attention of the IRS.</p><h2 id=porn-sells>'PORN SELLS'</h2><p>"I know porn sells and I get that but OnlyFans takes a huge cut of that, then there's her managers, then there's the people they pay to make the sets like hair stylists, make up and then the other girls who appear.</p><p>"It's upsetting to me because she's young how long is she going to do this for? Is she going to become a porn star or is she going to on the billboards as feature at the strip club?</p><p>"I don't want to know what goes on on the site, she's my daughter. But I'm sure that people will only pay to look at a naked girl for so long. There has to be something more and more enticing for people to pay continuously."</p><p>Ira said he wanted to make it clear that despite everything he still loves Danielle and hopes one day they can have a relationship.</p><p>He says he felt forced to give up parental rights to Danielle after years of alleged animosity between him and Danielle's mum Barbara - but says he always fought to have his daughter in his life.</p><p>Ira said he is also pleased that she has left home and has now bought a property near him in Florida.</p><p>He said: "I would like to say what I have always stated. That I still love Danielle and I never abandoned her.</p><p>"I would love the opportunity to have a sit down with her and discuss her concerns and reveal my side of the truth.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=every-daughter-needs-her-daddy>'EVERY DAUGHTER NEEDS HER DADDY'</h2><p>"Even though I was forced to give up my parental rights, I’m still her biological father and every daughter needs her daddy.&nbsp;</p><p>"It breaks my heart when I watch some of her IG videos and how she questions me about what I have done wrong in her eyes but not allowing me to answer.</p><p>"It is comforting to know that I am close enough to Danielle if she truly needs me in an emergency or if she wants to start a relationship with me and her two brothers who ask about her regularly.</p><p>"Even if she doesn’t want anything to do with me, Danielle can still have a relationship with her siblings.&nbsp; Family is such an important structure in a person’s life."</p><p>Speaking directly to Danielle, Ira said: "Once again, Danielle, I will always be your father, and like it or not you, will always be daddy’s little girl.&nbsp;</p><p>"I love you and hope that one day soon we will be able to sit down and talk like adults to renew our&nbsp;relationship."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>The Sun reached out to previous and current managers, Danielle and her mother for comment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000299975528-3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000685120700.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000685117279-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000729073865.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000299975539.jpg><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoV1fZVyaGxnkp2upXnBoZiboZWoeqWtw2aeq6eforKlec%2Boqadlo6mus3nOp6OynpGjwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
