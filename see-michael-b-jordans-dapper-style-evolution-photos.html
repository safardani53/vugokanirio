That day, he looked radiant in a red double-breasted blazer and fitted pants. Jordan turned up the heat by pairing the ensemble with a low-cut tank and a gold chain. He also rocked sunglasses and shiny leather boots.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>One of Just Mercy star’s most standout looks is perhaps the vibrant getup he wore to the <a href=#>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever premiere</a> in October 2022. Jordan looked retro in a bright yellow Louis Vuitton number that included an oversized jacket and high-waisted trousers. The Without Remorse actor teamed the set with chunky black shoes, giving the outfit an edgy finish.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In addition to owning every premiere he graces, Jordan has had his fair share of memorable Met Gala moments.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>He sparkled at the <a href=#>May 2019 soirée</a> in Coach — a clear choice considering the Fruitvale Station actor is the global face of the fashion house’s menswear line.

The rhinestones were also scattered across his pants.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“The Met Gala is an event that lets you push boundaries with your look more so than any other red carpet,” Jordan said at the time, per <a href=#>GQ U.K</a>. His stylist, <strong>Jason Rembert</strong>, echoed similar sentiments. “It’s like the ‘90s all over again in that men can really wear whatever they want right now.”&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>For the <a href=#>2018 Met Gala</a>, Jordan tapped Off-White for his style selection.
