In an unforgettable scene, she even attends a ritzy auction wearing a suit and a tie — which quickly gave rise to a new fan theory holding that she is gay. (Even though, of course, sexuality isn't quite as simple as one's sartorial choices.)</p><p>"Kate Bishop not only wore one but two suits that is so.
