It happens every year on Sept. 21. All over social media, you’ll see people asking the exact same question: &#34;Do you remember the 21st night of September?&#34; Clearly, they’re all in on it — why else would everyone be asking about one particular day in the ninth month of the year?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

All over social media, you’ll see people asking the exact same question: "Do you remember the 21st night of September?" Clearly, they’re all in on it — why else would everyone be asking about one particular day in the ninth month of the year?</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>You’re probably already aware of this, but just in case: “Do you remember the 21st night of September?” is the first line in the song “September” by Earth, Wind & Fire. It came out in 1978 but still gets some airtime these days — especially on, you know, the actual 21st night of September. But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>what </u><u>actually</u><u> happened on the 21st night of September</u></a>? Why did Earth, Wind & Fire want people to remember it? Here’s what we know.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened on the 21st night of September?</h2><p>If we’re just going by the lyrics of the song, then we know exactly what happened on the 21st night of September. Kind of. Love was changin’ the minds of pretenders while chasing the clouds away. Also, hearts were ringin,’ souls were singin,' and people were dancing. And stars stole the night away (we’re not really sure what that one means).</p><p>But surely, there must have been a specific reason why the band sings about that one particular night, right? Something auspicious must have happened that evening (whatever year it was) besides singing and dancing for the band to write a whole song around it! Well, no. Not really.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>In a 2014 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>NPR</u></a>, songwriter Allee Willis (who co-wrote “September” with Earth, Wind & Fire) revealed the real reason the song is about Sept. 21 and not any other date. She and Earth, Wind & Fire leader Maurice White worked together on the song over the course of a month.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’ve been waiting for this tweet all year. Yes I know it’s sad before you ask but. Do you remember? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/qfKmTz53EK</a></p>— Stuart Broadfoot (@StuartBroadfoo4) <a href=#>September 21, 2020</a></figure>Article continues below advertisement<p>“We went through all the dates: 'Do you remember the first, the second, the third, the fourth ... ' and the one that just felt the best was the twenty-first," Allee said. "I constantly have people coming up to me and they get so excited to know what the significance was. And there is no significance beyond it just sang better than any of the other dates. So ... sorry!”</p><p>In other words, there isn’t really any deeper meaning regarding “the 21st night of September.” It’s just an especially pleasant-sounding date that happened to fit the meter of the song.&nbsp;</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Of course, you could always instill your own meaning in the lyrics. Some years, Sept. 21 marks the autumnal equinox and thus the first day of fall (although in 2020, the equinox occurs on Sept. 22). Sept. 21 is also the International Day of Peace, National Pecan Cookie Day in the U.S., and actor Bill Murray’s birthday — there’s plenty to celebrate! Or you could develop your own unique Sept. 21 tradition so that you do always remember the 21st night of September.</p><p>At the very least, it’s the perfect date to play the song “September,” which is easily one of the happiest-sounding songs ever that’s sure to put you in a good mood.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnOp2StoJVif3K%2F02alop%2BYqXqwsoysnKmslaKvpr4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
