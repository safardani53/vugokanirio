“Oh my God, [the] worst advice [was] probably to make out with the gay bartender,” Cavallari, 36, exclusively reveals in the latest issue of Us Weekly, referring to a moment from The Hills. “Although, I don’t know, I guess it got us another season.”
Cavallari, who starred on Laguna Beach, The Hills and Very Cavallari, laughed off the awkward scene, noting that ultimately, she was happy with her production teams."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Don’t give them the option to show you not dressed up,’” Conover says. “He was, like, ‘Dress just like anything [positive]. Dress for the occasion, you’ll perform better.’”</p><p>While Conover has good memories pegged to his wardrobe choices, <a href=#><strong>Margaret Josephs</strong></a> exclusively tells Us that she regrets taking <a href=#>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</a> producers’ tips about her hairstyle on season 1.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The worst advice was to put on the pigtail extensions [for] my first season. They’re like, ‘Oh, you have to wear pigtail extensions,’” she claims. “I looked absolutely crazy in my first confessional. I [had] never [worn] long pigtail extensions. They’re, like, more over the top pigtail extensions. Worst advice ever.”</p><p>Watch the exclusive video above for more reality stars’ best and worst advice from their producers — and pick up the latest issue of <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKroaOptq95wpqtmqSclr%2BqecyoqZ5lopqurbXTsmSsrJGnwG6%2Fx5qpnmWSmsC1edaoqaysXaW%2FsLDUnJyrZZGZw6qvxGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
