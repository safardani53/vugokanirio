Learn more about his wife and her occupation. Azri Walter is an entrepreneur who owns a barbershop. He used to be a professional footballer in Malaysia.&nbsp;Azri Walter, a social media personality and businessman, posted a video on TikTok explaining why he had to deny invitations to participate in friendly football matches. He said that he refused the offer to play football because he believed he would be doing the other players a service by being the most gifted player on the field.</p><p>Furthermore, he feels that by refusing to join the football team, he will give other players an opportunity. As a result, Azri refuses the invites with humility rather than arrogance. Even though Walter believes this is a modest gesture, most people mock him because of his words.</p><h2>How Old Is Azri Walter?</h2><p>According to Wikipedia, <strong>Azri Walter</strong> is a nice, modest, and empowering person, as well as a sarcastic person who regularly makes others laugh.&nbsp;The Malaysian-born influencer’s birth date is not available online.
