“Some people go dancing together, some people go to the gym together, and swinging is our little hobby,” Liv tells The Sun."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But finding a single woman who wants to hook up with a couple is rare so we decided to branch out.</p><p>“We met our first couple six weeks after we joined and on the first meet, there were no expectations.</p><p>"We were just going to head over for a drink and see how we felt about it. But we went all the way.”</p><p>Gage admits the first time was nerve-wracking.</p><p>“You meet one person, you marry them, and that's the only person you have sex with, so when you go outside of that social norm, it’s treading new waters and you don't really know what to expect,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>“But the couple that we met were so welcoming and helped us ease into it.”</p><h2>Players' code</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/gage-alice-levin-liv-800841417.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/liv-gage-sex-swingers-800816039.jpg><p>As well as the symbolism behind the lifestyle, Gage reveals the couples abide by strict codes to make sure “playtime” has no dark side.&nbsp;</p><p>“The etiquette is that when you meet a couple, you create a group chat and you never go outside that group and start messaging one-on-one,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>“So if anyone tried to message Liv on her own, that crosses a line.”</p><p>Liv adds: “Everybody has different boundaries. Our number one rule is protection at all times, safe sex.&nbsp;</p><p>“The other one is that we both need to be comfortable. Whether we are hooking up separately or together, we both need to be comfortable.&nbsp;</p><p>We met our first couple six weeks after we joined and on the first meet, there were no expectations. We were just going to head over for a drink and see how we felt about it. But we went all the way</p><span class=quote-credit>Gage, swinger</span><p>“Other people may have different rules and boundaries - for example, the guy doesn't play with the other girl or there's no kissing involved.&nbsp;</p><p>“It's about respecting them, having a discussion before anything happens, and making sure everybody understands them.”</p><p>Protective of his wife, Gage says Liv's welfare is in the forefront of his mind whenever they are “playing”.</p><p>“If I'm with a woman, I'm still making sure Olivia is comfortable and we have code words," he says.</p><p>“She's a submissive woman, so saying ‘stop’ can be a bit difficult. If she asked me for a lemonade, that’s the sign she wants something to stop.”</p><h2>‘Normality is a killer’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8a635672-b85b-4019-80e0-967ae25bb0e8.jpg><p>While the couple indulge in the lifestyle both together and apart, as well as attending sex clubs, they insist there’s no jealousy and say the swinging makes their sex “mind-blowing”.</p><p>“Normality can be a killer,” says Gage. “If&nbsp;you're truly monogamous, you get used to your partner, you know what they're about, what they like in bed, and you don't think they're going to go anywhere else because you're married.&nbsp;</p><p>“When you introduce a third person, you understand that other people are interested in your partner and then there’s this connection where you see how lucky you are.”</p><p>The couple, who class themselves as “emotionally monogamous”, say that “reclaiming” your partner after they have had sex with others brings them closer.</p><p>“It’s like going back to the honeymoon period, or when you started dating and were excited to see each other," says Liv.</p><p>“It's kind of reconnecting with each other after being with someone else.”</p><p>Liv adds that after an encounter, they can’t keep their hands off each other for weeks.</p><p>“The sex is really good with other people, but once they've left I’m like, ‘Oh my God, come here’,” she says.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“That sex is mind blowing.”</p><p><strong>Sex Actually airs Mondays at 10pm on Channel 4.
