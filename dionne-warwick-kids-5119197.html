Despite the setback, Dionne assured the outlet that she was recovering well and eagerly anticipating her return to the stage.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The cancellation arrived as the “Walk On By” hitmaker has been experiencing a surge in popularity <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>online</a>. The music legend has been captivating an entirely new generation of fans with her signature wit and charm on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a>. “Remember: If I follow you today, I can unfollow you tomorrow if foolishness is your thing,” she once posted.

As Dionne wrote in her autobiography <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>My Life, As I See It</a>, it was only three days after their first wedding that she felt like she had “made a huge mistake.” So she took a bus to Juarez, Mexico. “It took all of three hours for me to get my ‘Mexican divorce.’ I took the bus back to El Paso and flew back to New Jersey a “free” woman,” she wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>After not seeing Bill “for months” after the divorce, he showed up to one of her shows in the front row with a bouquet of flowers, per her autobiography. “He declared he was going to “woo” me back. And Bill’s approach worked. Two days later, we remarried in Italy and this time our marriage lasted for 12 years and blessed us with two sons, <strong>David</strong> and <strong>Damon</strong>.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>David was born January 18, 1969, while he couple were living in East Orange, New Jersey.
