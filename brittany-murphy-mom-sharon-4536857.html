HBO Max’s doc similarly puts the Murphy matriarch under a lens, examining her relationship with her son-in-law <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Simon Monjack</a>&nbsp;</strong>before he eerily died of the same causes five months after Brittany’s death.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Below is everything to know about Brittany’s elusive mother, Sharon.</p><h2><strong>Sharon made the 911 call for her daughter (and her son-in-law months later)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/brittany-murphy-mom-sharon-documentary-ss-post-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>During the time of her death, Brittany resided in a home in the Hollywood Hills (purchased from none other than pop star <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a>) with her mother and her husband, Simon. It was Sharon who found her daughter unconscious in her bathroom in December 2009, prompting her to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>make the frantic 911 call</a>. In an eery twist, Brittany’s husband Simon died of the same cause, pneumonia, in the same home just five months later in May 2010, prompting <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sharon to make her second 911 call</a> for her son-in-law, too.</p><h2><strong>Sharon disputed claims that Brittany was poisoned after her ex-husband suggested it&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/brittany-murphy-mom-sharon-documentary-ss-post-4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Before his death in 2019, Brittany’s father <strong>Angelo Bertolotti</strong> had been vocal about his suspicions surrounding his daughter’s death, claiming that he believed foul play had occurred. Angelo had obtained his daughter’s DNA via hair and tissue and tested them for “heavy metals and toxins” in 2013, leading to his conclusion. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sharon shot back at her ex-husband</a> in an open letter penned for The Hollywood Reporter, accusing Angelo of “inexcusable efforts to smear my daughter’s memory.” She accused him of being an absent father seeking to capitalize on their daughter’s death, writing of Brittany’s death: “We will never know for sure. However, we do know the Los Angeles County Coroner did extensive tests and found that she died of natural causes. And now she is a real living angel in heaven.”</p><h2><strong>Sharon was rumored to be involved with her son-in-law&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/brittany-murphy-mom-sharon-documentary-ss-post-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Following Brittany’s death, rumors and reports were abound that Sharon and Simon were romantically involved. The HBO Max doc also delves into initial reports that <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sharon and Simon slept in the same bed</a> following the actress’ death, according to close sources and a Radar Online reporter who spoke to Simon at his home following Brittany’s death. In 2010, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sharon denied romance rumors</a> to PEOPLE, calling them “disgusting.” She said, “We’re close friends and we’re family. It’s an awful and ridiculous thing to say.”</p><h2><strong>Sharon planned to move to New York with Simon following Brittany’s death&nbsp;</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/brittany-murphy-mom-sharon-documentary-ss-post-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>About three months after Brittany’s death and just a few months before his own death, Simon told E! News in March 2010 that <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he and his mother-in-law planned to sell</a> the home they shared with the late actress and move to New York. “I decided to move back to my apartment in New York as had been my plan with Brittany,” he said. “Sharon said that she always loved New York and L.A. is just too painful for her; so would I mind if she moved too? Of course I don’t.” He added, “But I should point out we will be maintaining separate residences.” The outlet noted that they will “share custody” of Brittany’s Maltese, Clara. “We have been to hell and back together, and we will need each other’s support as we continue to grieve,” Simon said. Following his death, Sharon has remained largely out of the public eye.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8GroK2skaPGbrnUq6ehsV2ivK550qGYq6eeYoF2f5VxbHBn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
