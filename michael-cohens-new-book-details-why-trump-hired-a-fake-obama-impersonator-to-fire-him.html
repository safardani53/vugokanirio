attorney Michael Cohen reportedly recounts the lengths his former employer would go to disparage his predecessor, President <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Barack Obama</a>, once hiring an impersonator so he could "fire" him during an Apprentice-style video he reportedly filmed for the 2012 Republican National Convention.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The segment never aired during the convention, but the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>video</a> has been online since at least January 2013.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The new details about Trump's desire to create the clip has caused the video to resurface in the media after Cohen wrote about it in his memoir, Disloyal, which comes out Tuesday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to a report by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The New York Times</a>, Cohen, 54, describes how Trump hired “a Faux-Bama, or fake Obama, to record a video where Trump ritualistically belittled the first Black president and then fired him, a kind of fantasy fulfillment that it was hard to imagine any adult would spend serious money living out — until he did the functional equivalent in the real world.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Trump, 74, has long held a public disdain for Obama, 59, and has a history of making racist remarks towards Black leaders and immigrants from predominantly Black countries.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cohen's new book alleges a number of previously unreported instances in which Trump made such comments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Trump helped build his political profile ahead of the 2016 election by continuously pushing a false conspiracy theory that claimed Obama wasn't born in the U.S., while he's repeatedly attacked his Democratic predecessor throughout his first term in office by promoting other <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>baseless conspiracy theories</a> about Obama and the former administration.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Republican president has also routinely <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>insulted</a> the former president and his administration's members, calling them "human scum."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Obama largely avoided criticizing Trump throughout his presidency, until the former president began <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>swiping at Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic</a> before <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>fully warning voters during the Democratic National Convention</a> that he believes "Democracy itself is on the line" in the 2020 election between his successor and Democratic nominee Joe Biden, his former vice president.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In another part of the book, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Washington Post</a>, Cohen writes that Trump allegedly said he believes Obama only got accepted into Harvard Law and Columbia University because of “f------ affirmative action.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Post reports that Cohen's book also alleges the president made racist remarks towards Black people in general, including prominent world leaders like Obama and late South African President Nelson Mandela.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“As a rule, Trump expressed low opinions of all Black folks, from music to culture and politics,” Cohen reportedly writes about the president, who he says also claimed Mandela "was no leader."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Mandela f---ed the whole country up," Cohen writes that Trump said about the South African president, who led the country out of apartheid. "Now it’s a s---hole. F--- Mandela. He was no leader.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Nelson Mandela Foundation responded to Trump's reported remarks about the South African leader on Monday afternoon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We do not believe that leaders who conduct themselves in the way Mr. Trump does are in a position to offer authoritative commentary on the life and work of Madiba," the organization <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>said</a>, referencing Mandela by a term of endearment for the late president.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The statement continued: "Reflecting on leadership, Madiba once said: 'A good leader can engage in a debate frankly and thoroughly, knowing that at the end he and the other side must be closer, and thus emerge stronger. You don't have that idea when you are arrogant, superficial, and uninformed.' We would recommend these words to Mr. Trump for consideration."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Then President-elect Donald Trump sits with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office in November 2016, shortly after Trump won the 2016 election.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the tell-all's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>forward</a>, Cohen describes Trump as “a cheat, a liar, a fraud, a bully, a racist, a predator, a con man.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany disputed the content of Cohen's book in a statement to PEOPLE. “Michael Cohen is a disgraced felon and disbarred lawyer, who lied to Congress," McEnany said. "He has lost all credibility, and it’s unsurprising to see his latest attempt to profit off of lies.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cohen was sentenced to three years in federal prison after pleading guilty to crimes including tax evasion, lying to Congress about Trump’s prior business dealings with Russia, and illegal “hush money” he paid during the 2016 presidential election to buy the silence of porn star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Stormy Daniels</a> and former Playboy playmate <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Karen McDougal</a> — who both claim they had affairs with Trump.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Michael Cohen testifying to Congress in 2019.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cohen also reportedly writes that Trump once allegedly said: “Tell me one country run by a Black person that isn’t a s---hole."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The remarks echo a 2018 Washington Post <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>report</a> that Trump referred to Haiti and other African nations as "s---hole countries" during an Oval Office meeting, as well as a 2017 New York Times <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>report</a> that Trump once said immigrants from Haiti "all have AIDS."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In other moments throughout his presidency, Trump has stoked racial division — perhaps most infamously in the wake of an extremist "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>telling reporters</a> there was "blame on both sides."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Trump also has a history of swiping at opponents who are people of color, saying last year that four congresswomen of color <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>should "go back"</a> to their "crime-infested" home countries despite three of them being born in the U.S.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Most recently, when civil rights icon Rep. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>John Lewis</a> died in July and had his body laid in state at the Capitol, Trump did not make the two-mile trip to participate in the memorial. He was also conspicuously absent at Lewis' funeral in Atlanta, which was attended by three former presidents.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The White House did not respond to PEOPLE's request for comment at the time about Trump's absence at both memorials. When asked <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>during an Axios interview</a> what Lewis' legacy will be, Trump said: “I don’t know. I don’t know John Lewis."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cohen writes, according to the Post, that Trump's racist remarks were directed at a number of minority populations, alleging that during the 2016 election the future president said people of minority populations were "not my people."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I will never get the Hispanic vote,” Trump once claimed, according to Cohen's book. “Like the blacks, they’re too stupid to vote for Trump.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CkuarAyJyqaKWZmLWisctmmqiglaPAbrrEsGSbp5%2BgeqWx05qgpatdrLW6edOrrKaoXZ22s7HDZphmnpGgsm67wZqkmmWZor2mvtKopZqsn6d6tbuMn6CrnV2dtq57</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
