The <a href=#>Teen Mom</a> star shared a lengthy note explaining why she revealed <strong>Ashley Jones</strong>’ pregnancy on the latest episode of Teen Mom: Family Reunion.</p><p>On the Tuesday, January 17, episode, viewers saw <a href=#><strong>Briana DeJesus</strong></a> and Ashley, 25, get into an explosive fight involving their respective moms, <strong>Roxanne</strong> and <strong>Tea</strong>. As Briana threatened to “kick” the California native’s “motherf—king throat,” Ashley spit on her, leading the foursome to begin throwing things at each other.</p><p>As Catelynn, 30, remained outside during the drama, she informed her costars, including <strong>Jade Cline</strong>, that Ashley was pregnant. (Ashley and ex <strong>Bar Smith</strong> are parents of daughter Holly, 5.)</p><p>In a Wednesday, January 18, lengthy <a href=#>Twitter</a> post, Catelynn explained that “at the time of this whole altercation between Ashley & Briana, there were only 2 of us girls who knew Ashley was pregnant. I was outside when the actual physical part of the fight happened but I told Ashley (after all the yelling incident at dinner) that she doesn’t need this stress, drama, etc. because it’s not good for her & the baby!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Catelynn-Lowell-Explains-Why-She-Told-Jade-Cline-Ashley-Jones-Was-Pregnant-Amid-Briana-DeJesus-Fight-I-Will-Always-Put-Safety-Over-Loyalty-009.jpg><p>The Michigan native continued: “It was AFTER I knew about the physical attacks & risks, that I decided to let Jade know about Ashley being pregnant so that way everyone would at least know! Because I wasn’t sure what was going to happen!”</p><p>Catelynn — who has starred on the Teen Mom franchise since its 2009 inception with 16 and Pregnant — reflected on her decision but concluded that she made the right one.</p><p>“Was it right of me to tell Jade about Ashley being pregnant? No! … But honestly, I never thought Ashley would ever get physical & take that kind of risk with someone knowing she’s pregnant!” she noted. “If I were ever trying to fight some girl, I’d want to know if she’s pregnant or not! Or if I had a friend I knew who was hiding a pregnancy & she didn’t have control of her emotions & was about to get into a physical altercation with someone, you best believe I’d be running up there screaming at everyone involved, ‘She’s pregnant! Don’t touch her!’ so I could try & lessen the risk of something dangerous happening to her & her baby!”</p><p>The microblading expert closed her post by confirming she “will ALWAYS put safety over loyalty when it comes to prioritizing what’s more important and I won’t ever be sorry for it!”</p><p>Teen Mom: Family Reunion’s second season has seen its fair share of drama, including a heart-wrenching moment between Catelynn and her mom, <strong>April</strong>, who have had a tumultuous relationship throughout the years.</p><p>On the January 10 episode of the show, Catelynn cried as she confronted her mom over the way she was treated as a child as April sobbed.</p><p>The reality star has been candid about her journey since her 2009 episode of 16 and Pregnant, which saw her and her then-boyfriend, <strong>Tyler Baltierra</strong> — the two tied the knot in 2015 — place <a href=#>their first-born daughter, Carly</a>, for adoption.</p><p>The Baltierras have gone on to have three more daughters: Novalee, 8, Vaeda, 3, and Rya Rose, who was born in August 2021.</p><p>In December 2022, Catelynn exclusively opened up to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> about how she and Tyler, also 30, speak to their children about Carly’s adoption.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s all about honesty, really, when it comes to adoption,” she shared. “When they’re old enough, we can watch that together.”</p><p>She added that the conversations around the topic “will continuously evolve as my daughters get older and I have to keep explaining it,” but emphasized that “being honest and transparent I think is the best way to parent when it comes to our story.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqarJWhxq%2B6jKWmsJ2coXq4tNhmoGaroJ65rbHDZpisoJyaxm62zqecrGWgp7KousCnmrJlnprEtHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
