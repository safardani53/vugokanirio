The snapshot was first uploaded on Instagram by Alexis and was allegedly taken inside a vehicle in Los Angeles, California. Alexis captioned the photo she shared:</p><p>“One of the most attractive people I’ve ever met.”</p><p>Soon after, the duo’s fans swamped the comment area with love and fire emojis. Lamar Odom and Daniiellè Alexis, on the other hand, have yet to react or corroborate the report.</p><h2>Everything You Need to Know About Daniiellè Alexis</h2><p>Daniiellè Alexis is a well-known Australian transgender actress who rose to prominence for her portrayal in the television series Wentworth. She ultimately rose to prominence as an advocate for the LGBTQIA+ community in both Australia and the United States.&nbsp;Alexis is the first trans woman born in Australia to live and work in the film and television business in Los Angeles. She previously said that, as diversity grows in Australia and other areas of the globe, transgender tales must continue to be shown on the big screen. ATN Entertainment subsequently signed Alexis.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Daniielle-Alexis.jpg alt="Daniiellè Alexis" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In an interview with 7NEWS.com.au last year, she came out about growing up in Perth while enduring persecution because of her gender identity and acting career. When Alexis was six years old, her parents split, and she relocated to Perth with her mother and elder sister, Ashton. Alexis also admitted to being “confused” about her gender identification for a “very long time.”</p><p>Despite the fact that her mother eventually married someone else, Alexis said that her stepfather “fully accepted her transition.” However, as a child, she was subjected to harassment and bullying, as well as mental and physical violence. Alexis supposedly started her transition when she was 19 years old. Daniiellè Alexis was inspired to pursue acting by her elder sister, who was studying singing. She formerly worked on a BHP mine in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.&nbsp;The model and actress are presently attempting to become Australia’s face of transgender people. This year, on International Women’s Day, she urged everyone to “believe in themselves.”</p><h2>Lamar Odom’s tumultuous marriage to Khloe Kardashian</h2><p>Off the court, Lamar Odom is most known as the ex-husband of reality television star and business entrepreneur Khloe Kardashian. The ex-couple met at a party in 2009 and married shortly after. They even starred in their spin-off program, Khloe & Lamar, for two seasons.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Lamar-Odom-1.jpg alt="Lamar Odom" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>However, owing to Odom’s severe drug troubles, the pair chose to divorce in 2013. Khloe attempted to assist him by bringing him to treatment, but she eventually filed for divorce. Kardashian allegedly remained with Lamar Odom in the hospital for four days after he was admitted for a heroin overdose in 2015. She then dropped her divorce case in order to support and care for Odom, but the couple split shortly after in 2016.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGijmqWRp3qwsM6mZKKrXafCrrvRnptmrJ9ir6Z5w5qroqaXYrGiusiinKWklWKurbHXoqpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
