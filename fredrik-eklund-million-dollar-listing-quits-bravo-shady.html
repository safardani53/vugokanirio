"And to leave Million Dollar Listing.</p><p>"I let Andy, the producers, and the Executives know last week how grateful I am.</p><p>"Eternally grateful, I mean what an incredible run we had together.</p><p>"All of my most memorable milestones from the last decade I shared with you."</p><p>The news came as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bravo</a> star and real estate mogul was slammed by fans and peers for earlier behavior.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><h2>FREDRIK'S MOVE WEST THAT WENT SOUTH</h2><p>During Season 13 of <a href=#>Million Dollar Listing</a>, Fredrik switched coasts - moving from New York City to the Los Angeles sector of the show and he seemingly clashed with everyone.</p><p>"I wouldn't say anyone was friendly at the time, no," Fredrik told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ET</a> in September.</p><p>"But in the Bravo universe, I think that's how it should be. When you're new, you got to pay your dues, which I certainly did this season and you have to, you know, you've got to be in the hot seats."</p><p>Fredrik fought with nearly everyone on the LA cast on Season 13, including Josh Altman, UK partners&nbsp;James Harris and David Parnes,&nbsp;Tracy Tutor&nbsp;and&nbsp;Josh Flagg.</p><p>"The only one I didn't fight with was Flagg. And I love him, like how can you fight with Flagg? I mean, really," Fredrik told ET.</p><p>However that seemed to not be the case - as Josh Flagg accused Fredrik online and on Watch What Happens Live of spilling the news that he switched brokerage firms to Douglas Elliman (to be with Altman) before it was official.</p><p>Just days after Fredrik said he "loved" Josh Flagg, things got heated on Instagram, as Fredrik was accused by his co-stars of muddling with Josh Flagg's announcement.</p><p>"This makes me so happy," Fredrik commented when Josh posted about the news as was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">captured by a fan account</a>.</p><p>"Shut up," Josh replied. Adding in a separate comment: "Phony."</p><p>Tracy and David jumped into the replies as well all seeming to take Josh's side.</p><p>"Too bad some selfish loser spoiled the surprise," Josh Altman chimed in.</p><p>Josh Altman also told wife Heather that Fredrik was "straight-up shady" in an earlier episode.</p><h2>'AND THEN THERE'S THE REAL FREDRIK'</h2><p>Josh Flagg opened up to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> in December about how he "cut" Fredrik out of his life.</p><p>"We don't see eye to eye on a lot of things, but especially I'm just not a fan of ordering your own trophy.</p><p>"I was friends with him for a long time, and I noticed many things that I let slip, that I swept under the rug,<br></p><p>"But it got to the point where now that I'm a dad, you kind of just cut people out of your life that don't bring positive support.</p><p>"There's the Fredrik you might see on TV that you think you know, and then there's the real Fredrik.</p><p>"I don't want to make this a Fredrik-bashing thing because he's irrelevant in both real estate and my life. I just keep it at that."</p><h2>'NOT A SURPRISE'</h2><p>Fans flooded Twitter to react to the news that Fredrik was leaving Million Dollar Listing after a chaotic season of co-star clashing.</p><p>"Good!! He's awful!" one wrote.</p><p>Another commented: "He’s making the right decision. I’ve always liked him, but he lost his spark after leaving NYC for LA, which doesn’t suit his selling style well on the show, nor does being part time on the NYC version."</p><p>"Not [a] surprise," wrote a third. "He unfortunately rubbed every cast member the wrong way. He should just enjoy his beautiful family"</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Fredrik and his husband&nbsp;Derek Kaplan&nbsp;welcomed their twins&nbsp;Freddy and Milla in 2017 expanded their family alongside&nbsp;Derek’s son, Kai.</p><p>In 2015, per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PEOPLE</a>, the couple first attempted to have twins via surrogate but the pregnancy was a miscarriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000707250821.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000707250861.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000707250729.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Bravo's Million Dollar Listing L.A. cast slams Netflix's Selling Sunset for being 'more dating and less real estate'</span><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsZWh%2FcYGPaJ2rnZSntqx5xKSjrqaUYrqquMuipqdllKS5ra3RZqOiq6Seu6h50K6gratdl7%2Biws5mqqGZlK58</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
