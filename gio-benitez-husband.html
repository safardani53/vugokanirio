Before she appeared on RHONY, Tinsley Mortimer had her own reality show on the CW called High Society. The series only ran for eight episodes in 2010, and it centered on Tinsley's life and inner circle as a socialite. Tommy appeared on six episodes of the show because he dated star Paul Johnson Calderon.</p><p>Shortly after the show finished airing in the summer of 2010, Tommy spoke about the experience with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tall Dark Roast.</a></p><p>"It definitely was a drama-packed show! I thought the show served its purpose which was to entertain. I met a lot of great people through doing the show, but the life that the cast lives isn't a representation of what my life is like. I'm a normal guy living in New York City, working really hard in this industry."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He didn't always find common ground with his co-stars.&nbsp;</p><p>"It was hard for me to relate to some of the other cast members because my life doesn't revolve around what social event I am going to next," he continued. "My focus is my acting and modeling work and it is a really fast-paced industry where you have to stay focused on what’s really important. It's very easy to get caught up in the social scene in the city, but at the end of the day, I have other things that I focus more of my time on."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>If his reality TV past doesn't ring any bells, then you could remember Tommy from his acting career.</p><p>He appeared on a Season 2 episode of Broad City in 2015 as "Hot Lawyer."
