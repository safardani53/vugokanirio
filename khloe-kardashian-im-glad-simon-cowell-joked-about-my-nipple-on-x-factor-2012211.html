"You've all got dirty minds!"</p><p>Kardashian said she didn't have time to do a full dress rehearsal since "everything got moved up because of the hurricane and my stuff got stuck on the East Coast. "I tried the top on, it was lined with a nude lining, and I was like, 'Oh, this is fine.' We double taped it, and the first time I ever went onstage was when it was live!"</p><p>She continued, "Production was telling me 'areolas' in my ear! They were like, 'Your areolas are out' — literally! And I couldn't do anything until the break – that's live TV!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I mean, it is what it is. We all have nipples," Kardashian laughed. "But I was just like, 'It's my first day! Why did this happen to me? Am I going to get fired?' So when Simon said it, it broke the ice, because everyone was probably like, 'Dude, what is up with her shirt?'"</p><p>The X Factor airs Wednesdays and Fridays at 8 p.m. EST on FOX.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoJyksm63wKubmquYnq6vecimZKCkkZl6tLXMqKVmm5%2Bssq24jKOmpJ2UYq6ju9StZKaxXaO2sbzLnmSopl2teqetwq2mq2ViZX5zfpBqZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
