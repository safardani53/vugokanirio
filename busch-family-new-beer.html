Source: InstagramIt’s impossible to think “beer” without thinking “Busch” — one of the biggest names in the brewing industry for 150 years and counting.
But what has the Busch family been up to since they lost ownership of Anheuser-Busch — producers of Budweiser — and is it true they have a new beer in the making?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Busch family was recently approved to break ground on a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>new craft brewery</u></a> right on their property of 700-acres outside of St. Louis.</p><p>It’s also the first Busch family brewery to be built in the past 100 years, family patriarch <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Billy Busch, Sr. shares</u></a>.</p><p>Billy Sr. is founder of the William K. Busch Brewing Co., maker of Kräftig beer, which closed in July 2019 due to “market demand,” the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>St. Louis Business Journal</u><u> reported</u></a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here’s what we know about the new Busch beer.</h2><p>The family’s new brewery and distillery is said to occupy a whopping 20,000+ square feet on Blue Heron Farm in Defiance, Mo. It will produce a maximum of 2,500 barrels annually with enough seating for 265 guests.</p><p>Beer selections will range from small-batch, high-quality lagers to other artisan-style beers made with hops and barley grown right on the property. Some will be made available to distributors, and some will be exclusively available on-site.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>There will also be handmade whiskey barrel-aged beers and beer barrel-aged whiskeys, along with Kräftig Lager and Kräftig Light.</p><p>This marks a major moment for the family, with a place to call their own and continue the family legacy.&nbsp;</p><p>Billy issued a statement saying, “Family is everything to me. To be able to start this journey on land that holds so many memories is a feeling I can't begin to put into words. We can't wait to begin brewing classic and new vibrant beers at this new facility."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The Busch family are also new reality TV stars.</h2><p>MTV features the family in its new series, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Busch Family Brewed</u></a>, saying “no one brings the party like the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Busch family</u></a>.”</p><p>“With their good looks, athleticism, sprawling estate, pets and toys, there's never a dull moment for Billy Sr., Christi and their seven kids — Billy Jr., Haley, Abbey, <a href=#><u>Gussie</u></a>, Grace, <a href=#><u>Maddie</u></a>, and Peter — as they navigate their family legacy, relationship drama and new endeavors.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>When asked why Billy Sr. felt this was the right time to take to TV, he tells <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TV Insider</u></a>, “We come from an interesting history and there’s a lot of fascination around the Busch family. We’re kind of a household name, especially here in St. Louis. We’re also documenting building the brewery because of course, that’s the history we come from.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Anheuser-Busch?</h2><p>The St. Louis moguls were the brains behind the Budweiser brand for years before Anheuser-Busch was sold to InBev in 2008. The dealings were led by a group of Brazilian and Belgian investors.</p><p>This was a big deal, because the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Busch family</u></a> had been making Budweiser products in America since 1876 — minus a brief hiatus in the Prohibition era to sell ice cream and soda instead. That’s 150 years in the industry.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>It started with Adolphus Busch arriving from Germany, beginning to brew Budweiser, marrying Lilly Anheuser, and forming Anheuser-Busch.</p><p>Anheuser-Busch is no more, but the Busch family is alive and well, to say the least! They were among 20 of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Forbes’</u><u> Richest Families</u></a> in 2016, estimated at an incredible $13.4 billion.</p><p>Cheers to the Busch family on their latest endeavor!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl8K0r8dmnZqlmaHGbrrEsGSbnZWn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
