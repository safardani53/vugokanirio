His first marriage was to La Fonda Sue Darnall, with whom he welcomed sons Duane Lee II and Leland Blane Chapman. After their split, he wed Ann Tegnell in 1979 and welcomed three kids: Zebidiah, Wesley and James Robert Chapman.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1982, Chapman tied the knot with his third wife, Lyssa Rae Brittain, with whom he shares kids Barbara Katie, Tucker Dee and Lyssa Rae Chapman. In 2006, he wed Beth Chapman. The pair welcomed Bonnie Joanne and Garry Chapman before <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Beth's death in 2019</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In September 2022, Chapman married a fifth time when he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wed Francie Frane in Colorado</a>. The reality star's proposal, which came 10 months after Beth's passing, received backlash from critics at the time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My father has gone through so much this past year without my mother," Bonnie began in a lengthy comment on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a>. "It's been extremely difficult to see one parent pass, and the other so intent on following. My father deserves to be happy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In June 2022, Chapman revealed in an Instagram post that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>he had a 13th child</a> on the fourth anniversary of Beth's death. "But God redeemed this day when I discovered my son Jon, who I just met recently, was born on this day," he wrote alongside a tribute to his late wife.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything to know about Chapman's 13 children.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-christopher-michael-hecht></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Christopher Michael Hecht</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Colorado Department of Corrections</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Chapman had his first child, son Christopher Hecht, in 1972. At the time of his birth, the reality star was serving an 18-month prison sentence for a third-degree murder charge.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Christopher's biological mother is Debbie White, Chapman's then-girlfriend. After White died by suicide in 1978, Christopher was adopted by Gloria and Keith Hecht when he was six years old.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2008, Christopher was reportedly arrested in his native Colorado on suspicion of third-degree assault and crimes against an at-risk adult prompted by an argument outside a bar, according to local newspaper <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Pueblo Chieftain</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time of his arrest, Chapman coincidentally turned in a wanted-Mesa County man. Christopher <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>told reporters</a>, "I don't think he even knows I'm in here. I haven't talked to him in two months."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In February 2021, he was sentenced to three years in prison in Colorado after a menacing arrest, reported <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Sun</a>.

However, he's kept a low public profile after leaving the hit show over a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>rumored</a> financial dispute.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since his departure, Duane II relocated to Florida where he opened up his own bail bondsman business. "Children grow up," Beth, Chapman's ex-wife, told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Channel Guide Magazine</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"How long can you work for your mom and dad?" she continued.

Like many of his siblings, Leland worked at his dad's Da’Kine Bail Bonds. Furthermore, he's made appearances in the aforementioned Chapman-led TV shows and movies.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like Duane II, Leland also left Dog the Bounty Hunter in 2012 over a dispute with Beth. He, too, opened his own business, called Kama'aina Bail Bonds on the Big Island of Hawaii.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2006, Leland was entangled in legal troubles when he was arrested in Hawaii alongside his father for allegedly jumping bail in Mexico. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>CNN</a> reported the men were ordered to "stand trial on charges of unlawful detention and deprivation of freedom, charges which carry sentences of up to four years in prison." However, they were released from custody on bail.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for Leeland's personal life, he was married twice. In 1995, he wed Maui Chapman, with whom he welcomed sons Dakota and Cobie before their split in 2005. He also welcomed a daughter with ex Lynette Yi, before marrying model <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Jamie Pilar Chapman</a>&nbsp;in 2016.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Leeland is very active on social media, including Instagram where he shares family-related content with his half a million followers. Recently, he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrated being a dad</a> on Father's Day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Thank you all for all the Father’s Day wishes, that is the best part of my life .

Until age six, Wes lived with his mother before bouncing between foster homes and psychiatric hospitals. His past shaped his successful future.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I didn't want to be the kid that didn't have a dad, didn't have a mom, that was abused," Wes said in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>an interview with Business Insider</a>. "So I just started telling that story over and over in the mirror. It was as simple as that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By age 19, Wes was consulting for Fortune 500 companies, including Microsoft and Costco.&nbsp;He worked as a motivational speaker, often speaking to young students who were experiencing abuse or mental health struggles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Through his inspirational conversations and personal past, he created <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>A Human Project</a>, an "incubator for scalable solutions to systemic problems in education, health and society."
