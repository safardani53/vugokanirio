Source: ABCMany of us were surprised when Tahzjuan Hawkins strutted onto the beach for Bachelor in Paradise in 2021. We didn’t know too much about her, but the last time viewers had seen her on the beach was in 2019, when she left quickly. In case you forgot, she was so overwhelmed by the heat of the beach, she wasn’t even concerned with finding love at that time."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We didn’t know too much about her, but the last time viewers had seen her on the beach was in 2019, when she left quickly. In case you forgot, she was so overwhelmed by the heat of the beach, she wasn’t even concerned with finding love at that time. So when she came back for a second chance, fans were ecstatic.</p><p>Now, Taj is back on <a href=#>The Bachelor</a> Season 27 as a special guest. Is she here to stay for good to try her hand at falling in love with Zach Shallcross? Or is this a one-off appearance to remind fans of the adoration they once had for the Bachelor in Paradise legend? One thing that's for sure is, fans still love them some Taj.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @tahzjuan</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How far did Tahzjuan get on 'Bachelor in Paradise'?</h2><p>Things seemed pretty solid with <a href=#>Tahzjuan and Tre</a> during her second stint on Paradise. The two of them shared a kiss and seemed to be on the same page about continuing forward in their relationship. However, Paradise wasn't right for Taj the second time around, either. She self-eliminated before the second rose ceremony and fans lost her once again.</p><p>Fans were grateful that Taj had come back at all. She was basically terrified of nature and always had a fan to cool herself off. Maybe producers had to take extra steps to make sure she didn't pass out, but she was hilarious.</p><p>In a talk with Tre, she freaked out when a big bug came near her, and he stoically saved her from it. And in the interview room, she literally jumped on top of the chair when she saw a little crab, and fans loved it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span><p>Tahzjuan and Tre in 'Bachelor in Paradise' Season 7</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Outside of 'The Bachelor,' Tahzjuan is a real estate agent.</h2><p>According to her Instagram, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tahzjuan</a> is currently a real estate agent for Real in Denver, Colo. On her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>, she’s also a consultant for HyperTattoo, and in the past, she worked for Lyft as an Account Manager.</p><p>So unlike many of her peers, Tahzjuan is definitely a working girl. Although she is part of Bachelor Nation, she doesn’t seem to be pursuing the influencer lifestyle.</p><p>That could have changed once she stepped into the spotlight on The Bachelor Season 23 and then Paradise twice. It just comes down to the fact that Tahzjuan is real. We would also jump up if there was a crab coming towards us, and we love how she wears her heart on her sleeve. It does seem like she loves to travel, but we’re guessing she’s probably not going on adventure hikes.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Tahzjuan Hawkins (@tahzjuan)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What season of 'The Bachelor' was Tahzjuan on?</h2><p>Although Taj is remembered now as a fan favorite, so much so that fans loved her surprise appearance in Zach’s season of The Bachelor, her original Bachelor run was pretty short. She first competed in Season 23 for Colton Underwood’s roses, but she left in Week 1. Still, she left an impression on viewers even if she didn't leave with the first impression rose.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Tahzjuan come back on 'The Bachelor' 2023?</h2><p>Taj, along with Victoria Fuller and Courtney Robertson, appear in the Jan. 30 episode of The Bachelor to help Zach on a group date. While Courtney and Victoria are there simply to help, Taj wants a shot at Zach.</p><p>She tells producers that "Zach is the whole package" and says that he "checks all the boxes." When she asks Zach if she can stick around, however, he lets her down gently, much to the relief of the actual Season 27 contestants.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The producers calling Taj in to stir up drama among the girls because they’re too nice <a href=#>#TheBachelor</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7jdRmwhfkM</a></p>— Wait, What Happened on The Bachelor (@WaitBachelor) <a href=#>January 31, 2023</a></figure><p>Taj probably doesn't come back this season. But never say never when it comes to Taj showing up on another season of Bachelor in Paradise. Clearly, she has no qualms about popping up in the franchise from time to time and everyone deserves their shot at a final rose.</p><p>Watch The Bachelor on Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqa6recGamqGdnKS%2FbrXNZqeaqpGZtrSx</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
