Cause Of Death Explained</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-09-15</div><p><strong>Dan Carson’s obituary</strong> was published upon his death at the age of 60. Let’s learn more about him. Dan Carson was a well-known country and sports radio broadcaster who started his professional radio career in Calgary in the mid-1980s at Country 105.&nbsp;Carson worked as a radio broadcaster on Country 105 for nearly three decades, but he only took a short break to travel with the Triple-A Calgary Cannons baseball team as a radio host with CKO. Dan also worked as a game commentator for the Calgary Stampeders for almost 30 years. He collaborated with a number of people, including Charley West, Ray Grover, and Robyn Adair.</p><h2>Calgary Dan Carson Obituary: Family Grieves</h2><p><strong>Dan Carson’s obituary</strong> in Calgary has been released upon his death at the age of 60. Despite this, it is unknown when his burial and memorial services will be placed. Because no family members or authorized sources have provided information, it is assumed that all services would be held privately. Carson’s family seems to be wanting privacy during this difficult time of bereavement. In addition, condolences and sympathy messages for the family are coming in on social media.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Calgary-Dan-Carson-1.jpg alt="Calgary Dan Carson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>A friend of Dan’s paid homage to him, noting, “He has always been the voice you hear, and know, every game.” I’m sure he wasn’t at the previous game, and my spouse mentioned missing his voice. This saddens me much. I’m really sad to hear it. “May he find rest?”</p><h2>Dan Carson Cause of Death: How Did He Die?</h2><p><strong>Dan Carson’s death cause</strong> is unknown since it has not yet been disclosed. As a result, several claims have circulated on the internet, with one unapproved source claiming that Carson died as a result of a heart attack.&nbsp;It cannot, however, be proven. Furthermore, Country 105 was the first to report the devastating news, and while doing so, they noted,</p><p>“This is the most heartbreaking news. Dan Carson, our beloved friend and sports mogul, has died. For decades, Dan was the oddest of our little Odd Squad radio program on Country 105, and he was as sharp as a tack and wildly amusing.” The radio station proceeded to discuss Carson, concluding, “We here at Country 105 mourn this immense loss and remember Dan Carson’s legacy today and always.” “May you rest in peace.”</p><h2>Was Dan Carson Married Before His Death?</h2><p>Dan Carson was supposedly married in the past, although he was divorced at the time of his death. Tracy was Caron’s former husband.&nbsp;There is virtually little information available about their marital lives. When it comes to his personal life, Carson always kept his distance from the public. Carson and his then-wife did, however, build their own family when they received two children called Matthew and Kyle.&nbsp;The whole Carson family is devastated and in sorrow right now.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiamqSXlr%2B6ecOapWabkafAsLqMqJmirKWWv7p5x6iuZpyZmXqpsYydoJ5lk5bCtLGMqJ1mnJWWwal5xLGnpZmZo7Klew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
