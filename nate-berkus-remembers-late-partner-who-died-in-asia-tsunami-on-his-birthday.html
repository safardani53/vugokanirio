The couple was on vacation in Arugam Bay, Sri Lanka, when the natural disaster occurred and was swept out of their accommodation, a beachfront hut, by the force of the wave, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Berkus told Oprah in 2005</a>. They managed to stay together through the rushing water but were eventually separated. When the waves receded, Bengoechea was reported as missing and was never found.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">His family released a statement soon after saying, "Based on all of the information we have gathered and the search team's extraordinary efforts, we still have not heard any word of Fernando. Therefore, it is with great sadness, we are forced to presume Fernando died in the tsunami."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's been almost 15 years since the tsunami, when we lost Fernando. Every day I think of him, but especially today on his birthday," Berkus <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>wrote on Instagram</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Fernando's brother Marcelo keeps his art alive by hand weaving photographs using the same technique and museum quality materials," he continued. And while Marcelo's project is ongoing, Berkus notes, "this month, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>@fernando_bengoechea_photo</a> is donating 10% of proceeds from the sale of each woven photograph to the Tsunami Relief Fund via @globalgiving."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Fernando Bengoechea.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Nate Berkus/Instagram. Inset: Gary Gershoff/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The designer shared an old snapshot of Fernando and an image of the woven artwork made from his photography. The image of a Joshua tree is similar to one Berkus displays in his own home and can be seen in his former Chicago apartment, published in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Elle Decor in 2008,</a> and his former New York home in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Architectural Digest in 2012</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Berkus wrote candidly about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>his life after the tsunami</a> in 2005, recalling that the year began with him "lying in my bed, unable to eat, unable to string a sentence together." It wasn't until nine-and-a-half months later that he says he found a "new normal" and wasn't solely focussed on grief.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Nate Berkus.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Christopher Dibble Photography</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Remembering a celebration at his home, he wrote, "My best friend had organized the evening, my best friend who had flown to London to save me. Fernando's ex-boyfriend of seven years was at the table too. They were laughing and smiling. I was laughing and smiling too. He was a stranger to me before the tsunami. Now he is my brother."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued: "That night it occurred to me that I could again be 'happy,' that I was not defined only by loss and fear and grief, but also by love and joy and light."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>WATCH THIS: TLC's Nate Berkus & Jeremiah Brent Open Up About Baby #2 & the Unique Story Behind Daughter Poppy's Name</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Berkus <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>married designer Jeremiah Brent</a> in 2014 and the couple now shares two children, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Poppy, 4</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Oskar Michael, 1</a>.
