The 2023 holiday season is upon us. However, if you’ve been in a department store since before Halloween, you’ll see that most shops have started spreading Christmas cheer in their aisles.
Of course, Christmas is only fun with Jolly Old Saint Nick, Kris Kringle, or, as the kids call him, Santa Claus."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, the traditional decorations have become more inclusive, at least where <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amber Ruffin</a> shops.</p><p>In case you didn’t know, Amber is a comedian, writer, and the host of her Peacock late-night show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Amber Ruffin Show</a>. In contrast, Amber’s accolades are pretty well-known, although her shopping preferences aren’t as public.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In November 2023, Amber posted a photo of her shopping at a retail store. The snap showed a white Santa holding a list and a Black Santa doing the same. The similarities stop there, as white Santa and Black Santa don’t deliver gifts on the same blocks.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>White Santa’s list included "Thomas," "Mindy," "Tyler," and "Mary." Black Santa’s list, however, added the names "Latoya," "Nia," "Briona," "La’Shaun," and "Damion."</p><p>For Amber, seeing a white and a Black Santa wasn’t too shocking, as Black Santa figurines have been around for quite some time. However, the comedian was floored by how accurate Black Santa’s “nice” list was in the name department.</p><p>“LOOK AT THE NAMES,” Amber begged her Twitter followers.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">White and Black Santa’s name differences didn’t upset Black shoppers.</h2><p>Now, some could see the vastly different lists of white and Black Santas' names as teetering on the racially offensive line. The fact that “Latoya” belongs with Black Santa while “Mindy” belongs with white Santa certainly shows the creator has some bias, considering there are Black girls and girls of color named Mindy (<a href=#>Mindy Kaling</a> would like to enter the chat!).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, rather than deeming the Santas racist, we’d like to offer some perspective. If you grew up or are currently a Black child with a non-stereotypically “white” name, chances are finding your name on jewelry, tourist keychains, and clothing was next to impossible.</p><p>So, for many Black shoppers, seeing stereotypically Black names was a step in the right, inclusive direction.</p><p>“I spot “Dewayne” on the Black Santa list, and honestly, it feels right,” comedian <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DeWayne Perkins</a> responded on Twitter.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>“Separate but equal at its finest,” another commenter joked.</p><p>“Quinn & Kayla are also much prettier named than Mindy & Mary,” a third commenter argued. “Black Santa got the nice list, & white Santa got the naughty list, it seems.”</p><p>“Black Santa said he is taking care of HIS people,” a fourth poster said.</p><p>In addition to supporting Black and white Santa’s separate names, several X users felt the company that made the figurines shouldn’t stop there. One suggested the company expand to the LGBTQIA+ community to continue spreading inclusive joy.</p><p>“I need a gay Santa and a drag Santa..... With corresponding multi-hyphenated names,” the user noted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWqwMRmqpqmpJZ6t7%2BMm6Oam5tiwKK605pkp5mdmsA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
