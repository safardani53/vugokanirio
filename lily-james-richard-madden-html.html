After all, they were both committed to relationships with other people.&nbsp;</p><p>No one had really forgotten the apparent chemistry, though.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>So, when the couple came out with adorable monochrome snaps in the middle of the COVID-19 lockdowns, complete with suggestive captions, the rumors came back just like that.&nbsp;</p><p>In August 2020, James posted a photo of herself and Madden hanging out in a casual setting.&nbsp;</p><p>Madden posed for the photo clad in&nbsp;a black jumper with skinny jeans. The actress also opted for a&nbsp;casual look with skinny mom jeans with an oversized black jumper.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Making matters more intense was the caption that read, "Richard," followed by a black heart.&nbsp;</p><p>What's more, Madden took to his own Instagram to share another snap of the same day; only his caption read, "Lily," also followed by a black heart.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Sadly, neither of the Cinderella leads have come out with official statements confirming that they were dating.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>All things considered, it is possible that the two stars might be dating.</p><p>Still, it is more likely that fans have chosen to see the couple under the lens of their fairytale romance, and their romantic relationship is nothing more than wishful thinking.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSZocZutsCmnKxlop6wqa3RnWSmmZSZsq96x62kpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
