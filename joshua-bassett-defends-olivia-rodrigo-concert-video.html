Another fan said, “he’s so wholesome & good I love him.” Joshua’s fans also pointed out that the heckling about Olivia was especially disrespectful since “Set Me Free” is about his trauma from<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> childhood sexual abuse</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Joshua and Olivia, who starred together on Disney+’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>High School&nbsp;<i>Musical: The Musical: The Series</i></a>, allegedly were in&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>involved in a love triangle</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sabrina Carpenter</strong></a>, 23, which inspired Olivia’s hit song “Driver’s License.” Later on, Joshua and Sabrina fueled the fire by releasing songs with heartbreaking lyrics that seemed to be about drama between the trio.

He revealed that&nbsp;“the hardest thing” has been “biting my tongue, in a lot of ways, but the reality is it’s kind of like a lost cause trying to talk about any of that stuff, and I refuse to feed into any of the bullshit, so I just don’t.” Joshua added, “[Everyone] is asking me about Sabrina and Olivia. Why don’t we focus on these women for who they are? Let’s focus on the art that they’re making and how great they are instead of their relationship to a boy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH10e5BtZqOno53ConnBmqqsnaSpeqWxxZ6lnatdpLmqwsiaZKunlKe2qLuMnKanm5WnwW7CyJ2cqGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
