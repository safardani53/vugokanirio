For 400 years? That sounds like a choice. Like, that was there for 400 years and it’s all of y’all?</strong></p><p><strong>It’s like, we’re mentally in prison.</strong></p><p>Even Kanye eventually realized he had maybe crossed a line with this line of thought, sort of backtracking later on via social media, as you can see below:</p><a href=#><img width=1624 height=2216 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/kanye-west-in-white-on-stage.jpg alt="Kanye West Tries to Explain That Slavery Comment" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px" data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2 class=block-title>Kanye West Tries to Explain That Slavery Comment</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>During the court of his discussion on race with TMZ, West wondered why he was being attacked when he was simply being a "free thinker."</p><p>He later said folks just couldn’t handle his "new ideas."</p><p>The musician is either off his mental rocker or willing to say absolutely anything in order to promote his upcoming album.</p><p>Either way, however,&nbsp;Janelle Monae was not about to let his comments slide.</p><p>During a radio interview with LA’s Power 106 late last week,&nbsp;the singer voiced her disappointment in Kanye and shared her thoughts on the whole slavery situation.</p><p>"I come from love. I try not to listen to things to just respond or clap back but really listen to understand," she said, adding:</p><p>"I think we just have to be patient with each other. I don’t agree [with Kanye’s comments], and I’ve been very vocal about that."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/kanye-west-in-white-on-stage.jpg><p>And then she got more vocal, using Kanye’s own (stupid) words against him as follows:</p><p>"I’m a free thinker and here’s a free thought:</p><p>"I think that if free thinking is rooted in the oppression of minorities, LBGTQ, immigrants and women, then I don’t fuck with your free thoughts. I just think there has to be some balance.</p><p>"I mean, slave masters also thought freely, and where did we get with that?"</p><p>And there it is. There’s all that really has to be said on this subject.</p><p>Anyone is free to think however anyone wants.</p><p>But once you verbalize those thoughts, and said verbalizing has an actual effect on society, well… that changes everything.</p><p>Just look at how Donald Trump is taking advantage of Kanye’s endorsement on the campaign trail:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>According to one report, <a href=#>Kim Kardashian is considering a divorce</a> in light of Kanye’s recent string of idiocy.</p><p>Yet others are sticking up for the rapper.</p><p>"Notice that a week ago the world was silent about Kanye. Now the entire world is in uproar over things he has said or done for the world to see," The Game told Billboard via email.</p><p>He added:</p><p>"Don’t think for a minute that his actions and plan weren’t well thought out and set up for his goal to reach his maximum potential.</p><p>"Kanye will always be a friend of mine & although I might not necessarily agree with his views on certain topics, that is what separate us as individuals."</p><p>Based on this logic, one can say anything one wants as long as it keeps one in the news and there’s nothing to criticize because, hey, it’s all about "freedom of thought," right?!?</p><p>Sigh.</p><p>People can be so not very smart sometimes.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Kanye West Gets ROASTED on Twitter For Dumb Slavery Comment</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WCcLbAp5ylpJViurC6wJ5ko62jqXq1u9Oao6WxXZa7pXnCqKSppJWpsq3FjKiup52UYriiutieZLCdo6l8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
