He has a lot of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">different ethnic heritages</a> from both his father's and mother's sides.</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p><strong>Pete Davidson with his father Scott Matthew Davidson.</strong> (Photo: Amy Davidson's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>His father, Scott, was Jewish, something he only found out in 2017. "My mom just never told me," he said during his December 2017 <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">HOT 97 interview</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p>Pete revealed he did his ancestry test and was surprised to find out he was "48%" a Jew. Only when he inquired about the same, his mom did tell him about his dad's roots.</p><p>Scott had Polish Jewish, Dutch Jewish, and German Jewish roots, and had a bit of Irish and Italian blood as well.</p><p>His Polish Jewish ethnicity came from&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">his father</a>&nbsp;Stephen Davidson (Pete's paternal grandfather) and his Italian roots came from his mother Carla Kaiser (Pete's paternal grandmother).</p><p>Scott's mother was a descendant of German, Dutch Jewish, and Sicilian heritage.</p><p>As for Pete's mom, Amy, she has Irish, English, Scottish, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">German ancestry</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span><p>She got those from her father (Pete's maternal grandfather) Peter M. Waters, who had Irish ancestry, and Rebecca A. O'Keefe, her mother (Pete's maternal grandmother), who had English, German, and Scottish roots.</p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p><strong>Pete Davidson with his mother, Amy, and younger sister, Casey.</strong> (Photo: Amy Davidson's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span><p>So, with all these combined, Pete seems to be about half Jewish and half a hodgepodge of many other racial backgrounds, as is&nbsp;his sister, Casey.</p><h2>Jokes about His Ethnicity and Owning the Confusion</h2><p>Pete has been a subject of a lot of jokes about his racially ambiguous looks since the moment he became big.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_11"></span><p>The first of those jokes came from the big shots at SNL with cast members much bigger (and older) than him.</p><p>He joined Saturday Night Live in 2014, and at the time, neither he nor anyone else outside his family knew about his ethnic background.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_12"></span><p>So, naturally, jokes about his mysterious ethnicity became an easy thing.</p><p>Pete has never taken them seriously, though. During an interview with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">People</a> in October 2015, he revealed how he handled all the quips about his ambiguous looks.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_16"></span><p>"I’m a straight white dude but for some reason, I look like every other race mixed together. I’m all Irish and Italian but for some reason I look like a Puerto Rican," he said.</p><p>Further, he joked about how he used&nbsp;it "to my advantage." "I feel like as soon as people find out I’m just a white dude, I’ll start losing work," the comedian added.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_13"></span><p>In the years that followed, he appeared on Comedy Central's roasts for <a href=# rel=follow>Justin Bieber</a> and <a href=# rel=follow>Rob Lowe</a>, in both of which fellow comedians made jokes about his at-the-time-confusing racial identity.</p><p>The jokes, it might be fair to say, have died down since the details about him and his parents' ethnicities have come out.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_14"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKiVqbJusMCvoJ2rn6N6psDHp6CcoaSue6nAzKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
