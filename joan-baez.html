Joan moved often due to her father’s work. She lived across the U.S. as well as in Europe, Canada and the Middle East. Joan’s father took a job at MIT in 1958, allowing her to dive into the Boston and Cambridge folk-music scene. She gave her first concert in 1958 at Club 47. That first performance launched a legendary folk career, including her breakthrough in the 1960’s. Her second album, Joan Baez, Vol. 2, was certified gold. She introduced her audiences to the then-unknown <strong><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Bob Dylan</a></strong> during that time, and inspired similar artists like <strong><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Joni Mitchell</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Bonnie Raitt</a></strong>. Joan experimented classical orchestration in the later ‘60s, including a Christmas album. Joan made an appearance at Woodstock in 1969, and started lending her voice to political causes. Joan continued to perform and record over the next four decades. She also worked alongside other political activists, combatting poverty, fighting for LBGT rights, and raising awareness for environmental causes.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>Joan Baez is best known as an American folk artist and activist.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span class=celeb_profile_label>Personal Life:</span><br>Joan dated Bob Dylan from 1961 to 1967.
