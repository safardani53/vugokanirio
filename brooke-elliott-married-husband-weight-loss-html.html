In a male-dominated comic circuit, she’s considered one of few funny women who can go toe to toe with her male counterparts.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She has spoken freely of Hollywood’s disregard for plus-size women and the implications thus ensued. In addition, she has dealt with body image issues herself in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>On Live Set: </strong>Jane(played by Brooke) and James(played by Jackson Hurst) filming an episode of season 4 in 2012 (Photo: Glamour)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Elliot also has musical theatre credits to her name, including portrayals in Broadway productions of The Pirate Queen and Taboo&nbsp;and appearances in US tours of Wicked and&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>This article aims to cover all the aspects of Broke Elliot’s professional and personal life, from her movies and television roles to her family life and relationship status.

The two are part of an on-off relationship and decide to part for good after irreconcilable differences.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>And in season 2 of Sweet Magnolias, Elliot’s character<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Dana </a>was seen in a love triangle with estranged-husband Ronnie and bodacious farmer Jeremy.&nbsp;</p><p>Understandably, netizens have been querying the internet to know about Elliot’s personal life as well, as many have seen her onscreen performances, mostly in relationship plots.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>However, in terms of her real-life relationship status though, Elliot has had husbands and partners only in speculations and fantasies.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in 2021, a profile by Jessica Radloff for <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Glamour </a>on Elliot revealed the former Babes With Blades member was indeed in a relationship.
