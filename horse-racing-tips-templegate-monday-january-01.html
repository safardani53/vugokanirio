MARIE’S ROCK (3.15 Cheltenham, nap)
She can show her true colours dropped back to her ideal distance. She won this race in great style 12 months ago and tanked along for much of the way at Newbury last time before her stamina was stretched in the closing stages."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She won this race in great style 12 months ago and tanked along for much of the way at Newbury last time before her stamina was stretched in the closing stages. She is fine with some cut in the ground and trainer Nicky Henderson has been firing in the winners this festive season.</p><p><strong>BUTCH (2.40 Cheltenham, nb)</strong></p><p>He took his form to a new level when scoring over course and distance last time out. Olly Murphy’s hope was headed halfway up the hill but battled back to score by a neck. That was a really gutsy effort and he could well show more on this handicap debut. We know trip and track suit with soft ground right up his street too.</p><p><strong>BENSON (1.10 Musselburgh, treble)</strong></p><p>He may be a tricky horse to predict but the key to him seems to be Scotland as he’s unbeaten on two starts north of the border since joining rugby legend Sandy Thomson’s yard. One of those victories was this race 12 months ago and he’s only 2lb lower than his last winning mark. He should be fit from a solid fourth at Aintree last time and the cheekpieces going back on is a plus.</p><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">OFFERS OF THE DAY</h3></p><p><strong>Tote: Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label="CLAIM HERE (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Virgin Bet: Bet £10 Get £20 in free bets - <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Betfair</strong>:<strong> Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Bets</strong> - <strong><a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Paddy Power: Bet £20 and get it back as Cash if it Loses</strong> - <strong><a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow sponsored noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p><strong>Sky Bet: <strong>Bet £10 Get £30 in Free Horse Racing Bets</strong> </strong>- <strong><a href=#>CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p>Tote: New customers online only. £/€10 min stake (if EW then min £/€10 Win + £/€10 Place).

Some cut in the ground suits fine and he can improve further.</p><p>Peaky Boy is interesting on debut for Nicky Henderson. He ran well in a couple of bumpers for Michael Scudamore and was a comfortable winner at Newcastle.</p><p>He’s been off for 410 days but they can get them fit at Seven Barrows so he’s a big threat.</p><p>Innatendue should have won a race by now but she ran her best race for a long time when beaten a neck at Cheltenham latest.</p><p>That was her first run back with trainer John McConnell and she gets a handy 7lb from the boys which boosts her claims.</p><p>Champagne Twist made a decent start when fourth at Ascot on debut. He lost a shoe along the way, which can’t have helped, and he looks green in the run under Kielan Woods.</p><p>He should have learned from that experience and can get closer.</p><p>Diamond Dealer hung badly at Chepstow last time and is hard to fancy along with Glengolly who was poor at Newbury when last seen in March.</p><p>12.55</p><p>MATATA made a good start to his chasing career when scooting in by ten lengths at Ffos Las in October.</p><p>He enjoyed himself on the front in Wales and jumped well before landing that easy success. He was a decent handicapper over hurdles and looks open to lots of improvement as a chaser.</p><p>Petit Tonnerre has been thrown into the deep end of graded contests for his first two chase outings and has been far from disgraced.</p><p>He should find things happening a bit slower here and could be ahead of the handicapper.</p><p>Libberty Hunter took a tumble on his first spin over fences at Chepstow but bounced back in fine style to score by five lengths at Wincanton 13 days ago.</p><p>He likes some give in the ground so should enjoy conditions and is another with more to offer.</p><p>Fine Casting was a solid second on his chase debut at Ffos Las last month. He has done most of his racing over a longer trip and his stamina could be an asset if the ground eases any further.</p><p>Full Of Light is a full three stone out of the handicap and is hard to fancy.</p><p>1.30</p><p>INCH HOUSE has been impressive on his past two chase runs, landing back-to-back victories at Newbury.</p><p>He scored well over three miles before dropping back in trip slightly to score with plenty left in the tank.</p><p>Those victories came with some give in the ground and he looks ahead of the handicapper despite a 7lb rise for his latest success.</p><p>Given the form of Venetia Williams, you have to take a close look at Cloudy Glen.</p><p>He is 11 now but shaped well when fifth in the Coral Gold Cup at Newbury last month and has had a little nudge down the weights.</p><p>He may get his own way at the front of this small field and will enjoy the ground.</p><p>Angels Breath was below par when fancied for the Paddy Power Gold Cup here in November.</p><p>Trainer Sam Thomas tries him over a longer trip here and these calmer waters may help show his true form from a 5lb lower mark.</p><p>Stumptown was disappointing when pulled up in the Coral Gold Cup last time. He tries blinkers for the first time, which may help, and trainer Gavin Cromwell is in good form.</p><p>The Wolf stays forever but can make jumping errors which would be costly in this company.</p><p>2.05</p><p>STAGE STAR survived drama at the final fence to run out the easiest winner of the Paddy Power Gold Cup you’ll ever see last time.</p><p>He was miles clear and jumped the last well before sliding on landing. Harry Cobden worked wonders to stay on board and get going again up the hill.</p><p>That built on an already impressive Cheltenham record after wins in the Turners at the Festival and a big handicap on trials day.</p><p>This trip is ideal and his hefty weight won’t be enough to put the brakes on.</p><p>Richmond Lake made it four chase wins on the spin by 14 lengths at Aintree last month when this trip was ideal.</p><p>He’s up 8lb for that and Donald McCain sends him south for the first time. He’ll have to raise his game but has every chance of chasing Paul Nicholls’ star home.</p><p>Shakem Up’arry was fifth in this race 12 months ago and returns from 1lb higher after a fair effort in the Coral Gold Cup last time. This trip suits him better and he has an each-way shout.</p><p>Frero Banbou ran well for a long way in the December Gold Cup here before not quite getting up the hill.</p><p>They could go steadier in this smaller field which would help him get home.</p><p>Al Dancer was third in an Old Roan ruined by omitted fences last time. He’s run well here before and his rider takes off a valuable 7lb.</p><p>2.40</p><p>BUTCH took his form to a new level when scoring over course and distance last time out.</p><p>Olly Murphy’s hope was headed halfway up the hill but battled back to score by a neck. That was a really gutsy effort and he could well show more on this handicap debut.</p><p>We know trip and track suit with soft ground right up his street too.</p><p>Ed Keeper was impressive when bounding clear to win by more than five lengths at Newbury 31 days ago.</p><p>He’s been shunted 9lb up the weights but that looks fair and he has proven his stamina for this distance.</p><p>Springwell Bay wasn’t stopping when winning over 2m5f here last time. This looks slightly stronger company but he can have a major say if seeing out this longer distance.</p><p>The Newest One was second in a similar contest here in November before going one better to score by 19 lengths in the mud at Chepstow.</p><p>This is his sternest test yet but there’s every chance he’ll take another step forward.</p><p>Shantou Express has been travelling well enough in his races before running out of steam. He’s coming down the weights but this looks tough.</p><p>3.15</p><p>MARIE’S ROCK can show her true colours dropped back to her ideal distance.</p><p>She won this race in great style 12 months ago and tanked along for much of the way at Newbury last time before her stamina was stretched in the closing stages.</p><p>She is fine with some cut in the ground and trainer Nicky Henderson has been firing in the winners this festive season.</p><p>It was good to see Bob Olinger get his head back in front over hurdles at Navan on his comeback in November.</p><p>His finest hour came when winning the 2021 Ballymore and he did well over fences before a bad run at Punchestown last year knocked him for six.</p><p>Reports have been positive from Henry De Bromhead and he’ll be a big threat if able to build on that last success.</p><p>Strong Leader has smart novice form over two miles including when second in the Grade 1 at Aintree’s Grand National meeting.</p><p>He stayed 2m3f well enough when second at Ascot last time but faces slightly stiffer opposition here.</p><p>Brewin’upastorm won the Grade 2 Game Spirit at Fontwell in February but has been poor twice since and needs to find his very best to figure.</p><p>3.50</p><p>LA MARQUISE won with plenty in hand on debut at Stratford and can make the most of her fillies’ weight allowance.</p><p>She showed a good turn of foot last time and should be capable of better.</p><p>Kel Du Large had a fair bit left in the tank when winning at Exeter. He kept it simple from the front there and fought off his rivals well. He can build on that.</p><p>Sorceleur showed some promise when third in that race and can improve for Paul Nicholls and Harry Cobden.</p><p>Dirty Den won first-up at Huntingdon and ran close to that level when second at Hereford. He has an each-way shout again.</p><p>Carved In Stone seemed to have more to come when winning at Doncaster after a fair Ludlow debut.</p><p>Flat trainer Hugo Palmer doesn’t have many runners at this level and has a good chance here.</p><p>Authentic Legacy looks the most interesting of the newcomers. He is a son of Authorized and his dam is in Best Mate’s family so he’s bred for the game and trainer Gary Moore is in excellent form.</p><p>MUSSELBURGH</p><p>1.10</p><p>BENSON may be a tricky horse to predict but the key to him seems to be Scotland as he’s unbeaten on two starts north of the border since joining rugby legend Sandy Thomson’s yard.</p><p>One of those victories was this race 12 months ago and he’s only 2lb lower than his last winning mark.</p><p>He should be fit from a solid fourth at Aintree last time and the cheekpieces going back on is a plus.</p><p>In This World was a little unlucky to finish no closer than fifth at Cheltenham last time after being hampered turning for home.</p><p>That was his best run for a while and he’ll go close with a similar effort.</p><p>Afadil has Freddie Gingell on board taking off 5lb today after a solid third at Taunton last time. He’s on a fair weight and has run well here before.</p><p>Matchless was a game winner here two runs ago before going down in a head-bobber at Doncaster latest.</p><p>That was just his second hurdles run of the season so there should be more to come.</p><p>Holmes St Georges was well below his usual form at Aintree last time but he’s over from Ireland again off a falling mark and may have just needed that outing.</p><p>2.20</p><p>FRERE D’ARMES takes a step up in trip after his excellent second to the useful Boothill in the Hurst Park Chase at Ascot last time.</p><p>He hit the third last, which knocked him back, and he did well to come again and be beaten just half a length.</p><p>The way he stayed on suggests this trip will be fine and he has few miles on the clock for the Skeltons who won this race in 2021.</p><p>Cracking Destiny looks a threat after winning by five lengths here last time.</p><p>That was over two miles but he’s another who is fine with this slightly stiffer test. A 5lb rise looks fair and he'll be in the mix again.</p><p>Fidelio Vallis chased home Cracking Destiny here before a more laboured effort at Ascot. He is better than that and trainer Harry Derham is in decent nick.</p><p>Half Shot usually runs over much longer trips like the three miles he scored easily over here last time out.</p><p>He went from the front that day and could try to dictate again and bring his stamina into play.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Templegate's tips plus Irish selections</h2><p>TRAMORE</p><p>12.00 Gorgeous Tom<br>12.30 Belle The Lioness<br>1.05 Stoke The Fire<br>1.40 Buachaillbocht<br>2.15 Classic Getaway (NAP)<br>2.50 Making Country<br>3.25 Mahler Appeal (nb)</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>FAIRYHOUSE</p><p>12.10 Mollys Mango<br>12.40 My Trump Card<br>1.15 Lovely Reaction<br>1.50 Read To Return<br>2.25 Allegorie De Vassy<br>3.00 Nick Rockett<br>3.35 I Am River</p><h4 class=has-text-align-center id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here><a href=# aria-label="FREE BETS - GET THE BEST SIGN UP DEALS AND RACING OFFERS (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FREE BETS - GET THE BEST SIGN UP DEALS AND RACING OFFERS</a></h4><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
