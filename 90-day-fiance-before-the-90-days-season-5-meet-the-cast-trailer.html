The Nigerian musician, 32, previously appeared in season 4 of Before the 90 Days, which aired in 2020.</p><p><a href=#>After splitting from ex-wife</a> <strong>Lisa Hamme</strong>, Usman is now pursuing a relationship with a woman named <strong>Kim</strong>.</p><p>“I flew halfway across the world to meet the man of my dreams,” the 50-year-old San Diego native says during a teaser released on Monday, October 18. “I messaged him and he messaged me back, and I was like, ‘Oh, my God!’ And that’s how I fell in love with international superstar Usman, a.k.a. SojaBoy.”</p><p>Things quickly take a turn, however, when Kim accompanies Usman to a film shoot for one of his music videos. “Why would you bring me here to shoot a video about another woman?” she asks <a href=#>before throwing a drink in his face</a>.</p><p><strong>Memphis</strong>, a 34-year-old divorcée from Michigan, also runs into trouble with her beau, <strong>Hamza</strong>. She wants the Tunisia native, 28, to sign a prenuptial agreement, but he balks at the request, telling her that they don’t have prenups in his country.</p><p>That doesn’t deter Memphis, who replies, “If you do not sign, I do not want to marry you.”</p><p>Meanwhile, automotive engineer <strong>Gino</strong> is pursuing a romance with <strong>Jasmine</strong>, a teacher from Panama City, Panama.</p><p>“Jasmine is my soulmate, and I haven’t even met her yet,” the 51-year-old Michigan resident says in the trailer. “To be honest, she’s out of my league.”</p><p>The honeymoon period seemingly doesn’t last, because later in the teaser, the duo fight about whether Gino was talking to another woman.</p><p>“Were you texting with her, yes or no?” Jasmine, 34, asks. “I hate you because you broke my f–king heart!” In a voiceover, Gino says, “I think I made a big mistake.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Season 5 of 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days premieres on TLC Sunday, December 12, at 8 p.m. ET.
