Miami is gorgeous. Unfortunately, I can’t say the same about the women, at least not after you spend some time with them.</p><p>After last week’s debacle at Mynt, Romain and Joanna need to talk.&nbsp; He’s fed up, with reason.&nbsp; When Joanna plays it off like it was only because she was drunk, Romain shoots back “Maybe you’re drunk every day.”&nbsp; <strong>Minus 12.&nbsp;</strong> That’s a big problem.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg> <span style=display:none>&nbsp;</span><p>He asked her not to drink so much and cause any drama on his special night. So much for that.&nbsp; He needs more than an apology.&nbsp; He needs to know she’ll change.</p><p><strong>Minus 10</strong>. Don’t hold your breath, Pal.</p><p>Then in another twist, Joanna says she got a call at 4am from a staff member at Mynt. They said Romain was their making out with a dancer.</p><p>So if Joanna thought this was real, why not get out of bed and head down to the club?&nbsp; Was she too tired, or too hungover to care? Of course the one thing she must do is tell her sister.&nbsp; <strong>Minus 8</strong>.</p><p>I know she has to tell someone but her sister already hates Romain. No good can come of this.</p><p><strong>Minus 11</strong>.&nbsp; Marta has to spread the word to the other ladies.&nbsp; There’s a surprise.&nbsp; She says if it’s true she’ll cut his balls off.&nbsp; That might carry more weight if she weren’t leeching off of him and her sister.&nbsp; It’s past time for Marta to move out and get her own place.</p><p>Across town Adriana is being photographed by a famous photographer for an art show.&nbsp;<strong> Plus 10</strong>.&nbsp; Sounds like fun.&nbsp; The twist is that he wants shots of her topless.</p><p>At first Adriana is completely against it.&nbsp; Then she waffles.&nbsp; <strong>Minus 7</strong>. One minute she’s incredibly uncomfortable and the next she’s taking her shirt off.&nbsp; That didn’t take much encouragement.</p><p>In the end, <strong>plus 14</strong>.&nbsp; She’s a beautiful woman and the photos looked great…at least what we could see in the fuzzy televised versions.</p><p>And a <strong>plus 11</strong> to Frederic who in one of the funnier moves of the night whipped out his iPhone to make sure he got some shots for his private collection.</p><p>The photos are great but the art show is weird.&nbsp; Not necessarily the art itself but the guests.</p><p><strong>Minus 15</strong> to Lea.&nbsp; She’s such a b*tch!&nbsp; Who views a friend’s portrait and asks how much airbrushing they did?&nbsp; Or how about when she sees that someone bought the photo and accuses Adriana of being the buyer. &nbsp;</p><p>Even if she was kidding it was pretty lame but apparently Adriana doesn’t see it that way.&nbsp; She give Lea a pass on all of it but happily bashes Karent for much lesser offenses.&nbsp; <strong>Minus 9</strong> because Adriana’s downright cruel about it as she mimic Karent in front of their friends.</p><p>And I’d happily hand out extra points if someone could stop her from screeching “She Beat me to the Tweet!”&nbsp; Really.&nbsp; She tweeted before you could.&nbsp; Oh, the horror.</p><p>Maybe she learned the art of back biting from good friend Lea who drags James, aka Elaine to the event with the intention of bashing Marysol some more in public.&nbsp; <strong>Plus 12</strong> to Ana for trying to stand up for her friend.</p><p>Karent’s taking it from all sides this week.&nbsp; She’s got Lea and Adriana tearing her down and her mother telling her she hates Rodolfo.&nbsp; Unfortunately I’ve got to side with Mom on this one.&nbsp; If Karent’s looking to get married, I don’t believe the problems is that the timing isn’t right.&nbsp; I think the guy isn’t right. &nbsp;</p><p>Lisa and Lenny have real problems.&nbsp; They’ve been trying to have a baby for three years to no avail.&nbsp; Add on three miscarriages and they’re feeling the strain. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Plus 15</strong> to Lisa who seems to be one of the few people bothered by all of the gossip and back stabbing going on by these women. Everyone else just enjoys the drama.</p><p>The ladies all show up for Gay Christmas…or Winterfest and Lea’s still making snarky comments about Karent.&nbsp; <strong>Minus 10</strong>.&nbsp; That seems to be her gift. Well, that and marrying rich.</p><p>Joanna dancing is the main attraction but they don’t really show it.&nbsp; Just odd cuts of her in different poses.&nbsp; <strong>Minus 8</strong>. Was she that bad?</p><p>And I wouldn’t bash Ana for having a stylist…what Housewife doesn’t need one…but what is she paying her for?&nbsp; That purple dress looked like it came off the rack at Target.&nbsp; <strong>Minus 7</strong>.</p><p>Nothing against Target but these women pride themselves on their designer collections and that was one boring, frumpy looking outfit. &nbsp;</p><p>There was no sobbing this week, or drunken binges but we did get lots of back stabbing and some nudity so in the end it all evens out.&nbsp; ‘Til next week.</p><p><strong>EPISODE TOTAL: -35! SEASON TOTAL: -132!</strong></p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pqX2Z9cMDHnmSrnZGheqm71KycsKGmmsBuu8VmpKKZnZ56tLTEZpmemaRiuqZ506hkraCVYsG4scStZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
