last year.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Jim Bob</a>, 56, and <a href=#>Michelle</a>’s Tontitown, Arkansas property where their family home sits on consists of over 97 acres of land.&nbsp;</p><img

Sun can exclusively reveal they sold their neighbors 5.80 acres of one of the 20-acre parcels for $46,400 on January 28, according to property records.&nbsp;</p><p>A “property line adjustment” was filed by the parties in the days prior to the sale.&nbsp;</p><p>The Duggar family’s compound features the famous family home, daughter Jana’s greenhouse, a warehouse where daughter-in-law Anna and her seven children live, storage units, a log cabin where son Joseph, his wife Kendra and their three children reside, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>The patriarch has more than enough land to go around, as he had a <a href=#>real estate empire worth $6,235,050</a>&nbsp;featuring land, homes and commercial properties as of July 2021.</p><p>The sale comes after the family’s TLC reality show, <a href=#>Counting On</a>, was canceled in May 2021 after their son Josh’s arrest for child pornography.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>SALARY LOSS</h2><p><a href=#>The Sun previously reported</a>&nbsp;the family is expected to “lose $850,000 a year” after the show’s cancellation.</p><p>A source told The Sun at the time: "The family was roughly paid $80k for each chunk of filming, and some seasons were longer than others, but they were picking up on average $850k a season.</p><p>"I think a lot of people will be shocked to learn they were earning that much, and it all went to Jim Bob who invested some of it for the family, and handed the rest out.</p><p>"But there were often arguments about payments, who deserved what and whether people were being paid correctly for their time on air, that was a major issue over the years.</p><p>"Some family members are glad TLC pulled the plug so they can go off on their own and manage their own money, but Jim Bob is undoubtedly p****d because it was a huge income.”</p><p>Jim Bob had a failed run for the Arkansas State Senate District 7 Seat, as he <a href=#>lost by a landslide</a> just days after a jury found Josh guilty.</p><p>He currently has his real estate license and runs a number of businesses, including a RV park and property company.&nbsp;</p><h2>JOSH'S CONVICTION</h2><p>Jim Bob supported his fallen son Josh by attending the final days of his nearly two-week child pornography trial.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Josh</a>, 33, was&nbsp;<a href=#>found guilty of possessing and receiving child pornography</a>&nbsp;on December 9.</p><p>Josh was&nbsp;immediately handcuffed and taken into custody at Washington County Jail, where&nbsp;<a href=#>he was placed in solitary confinement</a>&nbsp;away from other prisoners for his safety until his sentencing.&nbsp;</p><p>He faces 20 years in prison for each of the two counts.</p><p>The Sun previously reported Josh’s&nbsp;<a href=#>legal team filed a motion for an acquittal of the guilty verdict</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In the alternative, the court papers also request a new trial.&nbsp;</p><p>If both are denied by the court, his legal team is asking to dismiss count 2, which is the possession of child pornography charge.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The government has yet to respond to the request.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Josh was arrested and charged&nbsp;</a>with possessing and receiving child pornography in April 2021.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
