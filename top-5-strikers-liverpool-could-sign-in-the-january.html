The Reds are without a doubt one of the most exciting teams in European football, particularly in the attacking third. Liverpool has wreaked havoc on opposing defenders with the likes of Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino, and Diogo Jota in their ranks.</p><p>While the majority of their rivals spent heavily during the recent summer transfer window, Liverpool saw very little inbound activity. The Reds appear to be relatively settled at the back, but they may look to add some forwards to help ease the burden on their attacking quartet. On that note, here are five potential attackers for Liverpool in the January transfer window:</p><h2>Number 5: Arnaut Danjuma</h2><p>Fabrizio Romano, a transfer specialist, recently confirmed Liverpool’s interest in Villarreal winger <strong>Arnaut Danjuma.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Arnaut-Danjuma.jpg><p>Danjuma has been a regular in Villarreal’s starting XI since joining Bournemouth this summer. In his brief time with the Yellow Submarines, the Dutch international has already made 15 appearances. Danjuma has been directly involved in nine goals for the club (seven goals, two assists).</p><p>The 24-year-old has established himself as one of La Liga’s best wingers in less than three months at his new club. Several English clubs, including Leeds United, Newcastle United, and Liverpool, have expressed interest in Danjuma.</p><p>However, according to Romano, Villarreal is unwilling to sell their star forward. The club has no plans to sell Danjuma, but Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool ‘adore’ him.</p><h2>Number 4: Karim Adeyemi</h2><p>Liverpool is reportedly interested in former Bayern Munich youth product <strong>Karim Adeyemi</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Karim-Adeyemi.jpeg><p>In the 2020 winter transfer window, he returned to his parent club RB Salzburg after a loan spell. Since then, Adeyemi has established himself as one of the continent’s most exciting prospects.</p><p>Adeyemi has made 72 appearances for the Austrian champions despite being only 19 years old. In less than two years since his return from loan, he has been directly involved in 42 goals (25 goals, 17 assists).</p><p>Adeyemi has been scouted by some of Europe’s top teams, including Bayern Munich, Barcelona, and Liverpool. However, RB Salzburg’s Sporting Director broke his silence on the matter in a recent interview.</p><h2>Number 3: Jarrod Bowen</h2><p><strong>Jarrod Bowen</strong> is currently one of the Premier League’s hottest properties, and Liverpool has previously expressed interest in the forward.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jarrod-Bowen-1.jpg><p>In West Ham’s recent win over Liverpool, the young Englishman made his case to Jurgen Klopp. Bowen had two assists on the night, helping The Hammers to a 3-2 victory.</p><p>Bowen has three goals and five assists in 17 appearances this season across all competitions. He has been instrumental in keeping his team in the top four heading into the international break.</p><p>The 24-year-old is one of the Premier League’s hardest-working forwards, making him a good fit at Liverpool. Bowen could also significantly reduce the workload of Liverpool’s brilliant attacking trio of Mane, Salah, and Firmino.</p><p>Liverpool has previously expressed interest in the English forward, but West Ham has set a £40 million asking price. According to reports, The Hammers have increased Bowen’s asking price for potential suitors.</p><p>While Bowen may demand a high transfer fee, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp may be willing to take a chance on him.</p><h2>Number 2:&nbsp; Antony</h2><p>Liverpool is reportedly planning a move for Ajax winger<strong> Antony,</strong> who has impressed in his brief stint in the Eredivisie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Antony.jpg><p>The 21-year-old made his first-team debut for Sao Paulo three years ago and has been on a steep learning curve ever since. Antony has made 59 appearances for Ajax since joining the club in the summer of 2020. He has 14 goals and 15 assists in 14 games for his new club, earning him a call-up to his national team for the FIFA World Cup 2022 qualifiers.</p><p>According to El Nacional, Antony is one of the names on Liverpool’s winter transfer wish list. He could be one of Liverpool’s most viable options, as they will almost certainly have to overpay for Premier League prospects, whereas Antony could be available for much less.</p><p>Ajax signed the Brazilian winger for a reported fee of £14 million just over a year ago, and he could command a fee of up to £26 million. Antony will undoubtedly be a long-term signing for Liverpool, and he could be the ideal fit.</p><h2>Number 1: Jeremy Doku</h2><p>According to reports, <strong>Jeremy Doku</strong> could be on his way to Merseyside during the winter transfer window.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jeremy-Doku.jpg><p>The Belgian international is regarded as one of the continent’s most talented wingers. He is currently playing for Ligue 1 club Stade Rennais. Doku is still a relatively unknown, but he has already shown tremendous promise at such a young age.</p><p>Doku moved to Stade Rennais a year ago for £23.4 million. His worth could have risen since then. According to a recent report by RTL Sports journalist Alexandre Braeckman, Liverpool is the ‘best placed’ to sign Doku.</p><p>According to reports in the Mail Online and Liverpool Echo, Liverpool is still interested in signing the young winger. Liverpool is expected to pay more than £30 million for Doku.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKhdanq0wNGiop6qo2K5qsLEq6eop5xisLDBy51krKGXo3qquoytn55lmpa7tq3RsmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
