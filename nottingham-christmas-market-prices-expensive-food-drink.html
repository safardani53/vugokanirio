Nottingham's Winter Wonderland has been transformed in the lead-up to Christmas with an ice rink, live music, and stalls offering food and drink.
There are fair-ground rides and a Helter Skelter Bar where the kids can go down the slide while the adults drink something festive. 
But, despite attendees praising the market's design, they weren't so charitable about the prices."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We have just had a meal in a pub for not much more than that."</p><p>Elisha added: "They have created a good atmosphere but you can expect to pay extra. We’ll probably go back to a pub for a drink."</p><p>Restaurant worker Shane Lee, 28, from Leicester, was out with student Ruby Hathaway, 18.</p><p>"We are so impressed," said Ruby.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>"It is really nice. We have just been in an ice bar where it was minus 10 and you got two drinks each served in ice glasses.</p><p>"It was £19 but it was brilliant. They even had coats on offer if you weren’t dressed for it."</p><p>Shane added: "This German sausage was £8. The prices are a bit high but they have to make a profit somehow.</p><p>"This is so much better than Leicester where we have a big Christmas tree with nothing on it, a small well, two kids’ rides and a doughnut stand."</p><p>Student Kiera Chera, 21 and salesman Harley Shand, 23, were enjoying toasted marshmallows - £4.50 for three. &nbsp;</p><p>She said: "It is such a friendly atmosphere. I just love coming to town in the middle of the week and finding so many people out enjoying themselves.</p><p>"Normally it would just be a few students. It really gets you in the festive mood."</p><p>Her friend Harley added: "You will pay £7 a pint which is a couple of quid more than in a pub but you are paying for the atmosphere.</p><p>"It’s really well done. You can reserve, get something to eat, Nottingham should be proud of it."</p><p>Melissa Kroger, 41 and Abi Priestley, 46, meet up every three months to discuss their businesses and had stumbled upon the Christmas market by chance.&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoying a bit of fizz and a chat, Melissa from Doncaster said: "This was a real surprise. We came to discuss business and ended up skating. &nbsp;</p><p>"Now we have survived that we’re having a drink. I’ve seen a lot of Christmas markets – Birmingham, Sheffield, Leicester Square, but this has the best atmosphere of all. It’s absolutely brilliant."</p><p>Abi, sipping on some mulled wine, said: "I don’t think it’s over-priced. If you were here with a family, you might feel it, but the prices reflect that you are getting more than a drink. &nbsp;</p><p>"You can’t put a price on that smell of all the different food stalls wafting around the place. There’s live music, there’s snow, there’s just lots of extra entertainment so of course you will pay a bit extra."&nbsp;</p><p>Skating is by the hour and cost £15 for an adult, £9.50 for under 8s and £12 for under 15s and students. A family ticket comes in at £44.&nbsp;</p><p>Less heavy on the pocket was the Toboggan Run where punters could ride a giant tyre down a steep slope for £5 for two rides and the Carousel which was £4 per person. &nbsp;</p><p>Photographer Rayah, 20, was trying to be circumspect. "I think some things are a bit overpriced. After all we are in a cost of living crisis so it is tough for people. We are just browsing and taking in the atmosphere."</p><p>Her friend Gorang, 20, added: "I think the bar is cheaper. We’ll probably end up there."</p><p>Civil litigation boss Jackie Lambert, 62, and Jason Barlow, 54, a project manager, were having a couple of drinks before seeing Jools Holland performing in town.&nbsp;</p><p>Jackie said: "I do think the stalls are a bit samey. There is too much cheese – you don’t need three or four stalls doing the same thing and several rather basic hat and glove stalls. It would be nice is they have a few more unique crafts."</p><p>Jason said: "They have created a good atmosphere. You would never know you were in the middle of market square."</p><p>One of the more unique offered Viking drinking horns in every measurement from 50mls to two litres with the prices stretching from £10 to £80. &nbsp;</p><p>Jackie was still unimpressed: "I have heard they come with a bit of an after-taste so I will be swerving them," she added.&nbsp;</p><p>Other stalls offered mead to drink, as well as jewellery, scents and Ferrero Rochet hot chocolates at £5 a time. &nbsp;</p><p>Tubs of ready to eat roast potatoes were available for £7 and handmade fudge was £3.19 per 100 grams.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry and Tiffany Wright, 21 and 22 respectively, had brought their niece and nephew Eva and Henry, aged 10 and three, out for the night.&nbsp;</p><p>"It has been really lovely treat," said Tiffany.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"We have been on a few rides and had some food. It is so easy to get to with all the buses and trams we’ve got and this is an improvement on years gone by."</p><p>Winter Wonderland Nottingham lasts until New Year’s Eve.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/leon-images-nottingham-winter-wonderland-861507483.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/leon-images-nottingham-winter-wonderland-861506425.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4F5g5VsbnFnnqTBtbXNoJ%2BapV2YtbO10q2kmqtdoq6zt8StZKmqmZiytHnEsaeepqOew6Z5xaimnWWUp7avt44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
