Learn. Play.” The foundation is committed to unlocking the potential of every child.</p><p>You can learn more about their foundation at <a href=# rel=noopener>www.eatlearnplay.org</a>.</p><p>Now, let’s learn more about Stephen Curry and Ayesha Curry’s&nbsp;third child, Canon Curry.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Story Behind The Name Of Stephen Curry’s Son?&nbsp;</h2><p>Steph and Ayesha had picked Canon’s name when they were pregnant with their first child.</p><p>However, their first child was a girl, so they went on with the name Riley. Their second child was also a girl, and they named her Ryan.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Ayesha was pregnant for the third time.</p><p>They learned that this time they were going to have a son. As a result, the name ‘Canon’ slipped their brain again.&nbsp;</p><p>However, they also had other names for their son in their mind. For instance, the pair had also considered naming their child ‘Wardell Stephen Curry III.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Stephens-kids.jpg><p>The rationale behind the name was that the little boy was born to Stephen, and his grandfather’s name was Dell. Also, he was the third Wardell in the family.&nbsp;</p><p>The name ‘Wardell Stephen Curry III’ would carry the family tradition. Steph and Ayesha had also decided to give their son the nickname ‘Trey.’</p><p>However, the couple could not let go of the name Canon. The name felt right to them. So,&nbsp; they ultimately decided to name their baby boy Canon, the name they had picked 9 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, to keep the family ties in the name, they put the word ‘Jack’ in the middle as a tribute to his grandfather.&nbsp;</p><p>Canon’s full name is Canon Wardell Jack Curry.&nbsp;</p><p>Ayesha and Steph did not know the meaning of the name when they had first chosen it.&nbsp;</p><p>However, after some research, the couple found that ‘Canon’ meant a young wolf and an official of the church.</p><p>So, they decided to keep calling the 5 years old boy, Canon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Does Stephen Curry’s Son Look Like Him?</h2><p>Canon Curry looks just like his father, Steph Curry, which is proven by the photos he posts on the internet.&nbsp;</p><p>Steph and Canon both had wide grins, and we must admit that they resembled each other.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Stephen-curry-son-and-stephen-look-alike.png><p>Like father, like son. What more can we say?&nbsp;</p><h2>Cannon Curry: Siblings</h2><p>Cannon Curry has two sisters, <a href=# rel=noopener>Riley Elizabeth Curry,</a> and Ryan Carson Curry.&nbsp;</p><p>On July 19, 2012, Riley was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, to Steph and Ayesha.
