In fact, it's unclear if they ever had a great relationship as things already seemed rough by the time she was 13.</p><p>When we were first introduced to the mother-daughter duo on Dr. Phil, Barbara claimed that her daughter was "ungovernable" and "out of control." Furthermore, footage of their home life showed that they often physically attacked each other.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>After the show, Barabra agreed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">send Bhad Bhabie to a Dr Phil-vetted reform camp</a> for six months where the teen later said she was abused, likely causing her to resent her mom even more.</p><p>As Bhad Bhabie rose to fame, her mom began making a profit off her and things seemed to simmer down.</p><p>In 2017, the teen even surprised her mom for Christmas in an emotional video when she gave her money to pay off her mortgage.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, it appeared Barbara expected the money to continue flowing her way ever after her daughter turned 18 and was legally an adult.</p><p>As Bhad Bhabie insinuated to Emily Ratajkowsk in April 2023 on her podcast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">High Low with EmRata</a>, Barbara was hungry for cash and didn't care how it was made. "That lady love money, she don't give a f--- where it come from."</p><p>But there's more to their drama than just money. Bhad Bhabie opened up about her mom in August 2023 on Instagram Stories, which the account <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@teatotalk</a> later shared.</p><p>“I live in fear of this lady every day. She’s mentally sick and I’m scared of what she’s capable of. Don’t think I have her around because I want to," Bhad Bhabie wrote, explaining that she has asked her mom to move out and offered to buy her a house, but she wouldn't leave.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"I'm tired of her living a false narrative on social media.
