The two were married for seven years, so the Project Ladybug founder, 41, has been out of the game for quite some time.</p><p>“When I pictured myself 40-something, this was not what I was expecting,” she confesses. “The last time I had to get naked in front of a guy, I was 28 years old…There’s definitely anxiety around that.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=485 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Dina Manzo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>There’s also some nervousness around her daughter Lexi’s departure for college. (Lexi, 17, is Manzo’s child from her first marriage.) “It’s the end of an era as a mom,” she says. “Now I just have to worry about my f—ed-up pets.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Manzo’s RHONJ comeback follows the departure of her estranged sister, <strong>Caroline</strong>, who left the series after five seasons last October. Announcing her return in previews for upcoming episodes, the interior decorator says cheekily, “The bitch is back, and if you don’t like it, you can kiss my ass.”</p><p>Watch the video above to see more, and tune in to the RHONJ preview special on Sunday, June 1, at 10 p.m. ET.
