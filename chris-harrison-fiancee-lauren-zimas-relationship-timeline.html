Chris Harrison and Lauren Zima first connected professionally while working on The Bachelor and Entertainment Tonight, respectively, but their relationship eventually blossomed into something more.
The couple started dating in August 2018 after the former “Roses and Rosé” host made the first move by sliding into Harrison’s DMs after feeling a “vibe.” During a July 2019 interview with former Bachelor Nick Viall, Zima said she knew the Perfect Letter author for about three years before they started getting flirtatious."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He mentioned something about picking his kids up or something. He somehow brought up being single, I think. And then I said something like, ‘I’m single now,’ and he was like, ‘Oh.’ But I said it in a more eloquent way. … I opened the door and he walked through.”</p><p>The pair <a href=#>made their relationship red carpet official</a> in January 2019, appearing together at a party for the Screen Actors Guild Awards. Several months later, Zima <a href=#>celebrated the couple’s one-year anniversary</a> with an Instagram tribute to her beau.</p><p>“In this year I’ve leaned on you, laughed with you and fallen in love with you for the incredible man that you are,” she wrote in August 2019. “Thank you for adding to my life with your positivity, perspective and patience, and for supporting me in becoming exactly who I want to be.”</p><p>The twosome <a href=#>sparked marriage rumors in early 2021</a> when Harrison posted a photo of his then-girlfriend in a white gown that looked like a wedding dress, but he later clarified that the picture was from a wedding they’d attended where Zima was a bridesmaid.</p><p>Several months later, however, <a href=#>the pair made the next move and got engaged</a>. “I love you @laurenzima The next chapter starts now!” the Texas native wrote in October 2021 in an Instagram post announcing the news.</p><p>“I didn’t know love could be like this,” Zima added in her own post. “You are the most incredible partner.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Harrison was previously wed to his college sweetheart, <strong>Gwen Harrison</strong>.
