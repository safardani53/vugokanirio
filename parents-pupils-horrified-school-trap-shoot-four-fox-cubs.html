This is only a short-term fix and other foxes will move in.</p><p>"As they will be setting up territories, it is likely there will actually be more faeces as other foxes dispute the temporarily vacant territory."</p><p>She added: "Culling wildlife sends a bad message to the students - that wildlife is a problem, rather than part of a solution to the global issue of loss of biodiversity."</p><p>Christian school Littlehampton Academy was slammed for being “hypocrites" after her vixen and her young were shot dead by a paid marksman.</p><p>Elaine Clayton, whose child attends the school said: “This poor fox and her family’s lives were snuffed out by disgusting humans."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>An academy spokesman said: “We did look at trapping them as an option but, once trapped they would be destroyed, and on balance we felt allowing them to be trapped and held in cages for a period before being destroyed was a worse option.</p><p>“This is not something we decided on lightly but I hope that you can see that as an educational establishment with over 1,300 children on site we have a responsibility to ensure their safety and health, and so we took this difficult decision.”</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Chris Packham: 'The body of a snared fox has been dumped at my house'</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoNyhZJwaGtnoJa%2FprrTrGSpraCeubR5x6ipq6GWnrKledKcn6innGLBs63PZqqhp5%2Bpeqe71Ktkn6eoYrC2rtJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
