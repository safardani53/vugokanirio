Like, has she ever just made one single good choice in her whole entire life?
Looking back … it kind of doesn’t seem like it, does it?
But while Farrah fails in a lot of ways, her poor parenting choices are what really stand out as especially appalling."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She OBVIOUSLY doesn’t need photoshop… so idk why u would edit her face."</p><p>And if you wanted more things to look for, another person detailed "Her nose is chiseled narrow, face slendered, and eyes closer together. Chin also looks more pointed."</p><p>"These are definitely changed.

But then, you as a mother would."</p><p>But one of the most popular comments was a simple question: "Why does the daughter’s face looked so photoshopped?"</p><p>That was a question that Farrah took the time to answer.</p><p>"It’s not," she wrote, adding a laughing emoji. "Sophia is gorgeous as is!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The thing is that no one is saying that Sophia isn’t pretty or that she needs her photos edited — they’re just saying that it really, really looks like these photos were edited.</p><p>Of course, Farrah has trouble understanding pretty much everything, so it makes sense that she’d have trouble putting that together.</p><p>We would say that we hope Sophia doesn’t take any of this personally, but since Farrah is her sole parent, this kind of thing is probably the least of her worries.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Farrah Abraham Is Traumatizing Her Daughter: Here’s the Proof</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>All we have to say is what a mess.</p><p>What a mess.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2toX2Z9cLLAq6maoF2Wr7Otx5qkZqGjYsCpsYypn6isn6i1sLzPoqWgZZiav26wwK6eoayVp8BuvMeoq6irXaO8uHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
