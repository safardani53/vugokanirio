Few details about the singer’s death were publicly available. The tragic news comes only 18 months after she suffered the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> loss of her 17-year-old son, <strong>Shane</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sinead-OConnor-1999-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>The Irish hitmaker was one of the most critically-acclaimed pop stars of the 90s. Sinead made her musical debut in 1987 with her album The Lion And The Cobra,&nbsp;and she quickly rose to fame with her 1990 sophomore effort&nbsp;I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got,&nbsp;which included a chart-topping cover of<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;</a><strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Prince’s</a>&nbsp;</strong>“Nothing Compares 2 U.” After a controversial appearance on&nbsp;Saturday Night Live,&nbsp;which included her ripping up a photo of Pope&nbsp;<strong>John Paul II,&nbsp;</strong>Sinéad faced serious backlash. Despite the controversy, she’s continued to release music, with her most recent album being 2014’s&nbsp;I’m Not Bossy, I’m The Boss, and she’s anticipated to drop what she described as her final album&nbsp;No Veteran Dies Alone in 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Throughout her life, Sinéad had been married four times and has had four children. The singer sadly shared that her third child&nbsp;<strong>Shane&nbsp;</strong>had died by suicide at age 17 in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>January 17 tweet</a>. “My beautiful son, Nevi’im Nesta Ali Shane O’Connor, the very light of my life, decided to end his earthly struggle today and is now with God,” she wrote.

The singer gave birth to her oldest son&nbsp;<strong>Jake Reynolds,&nbsp;</strong>34, in June 1987. While Sinéad and John’s marriage didn’t work out, the pair have continued to collaborate on a number of albums since the 1991 divorce, including Sinéad’s 2014 record. Jake has a child of his own, making Sinéad a grandmother. She announced her son’s child’s birth in a 2015 Facebook post, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Independent.ie</a>.&nbsp;“This for Lia and Jake and their little angel, who flew about with me in Vegas last week as I was singing the Foggy Dew,” she wrote.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>While Jake has mostly stayed out of the spotlight, his mom made a few since-deleted public Facebook posts about him regarding a custody battle in May 2016, via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>NBC News.&nbsp;</a>The mother and son appeared to have an occasionally<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> tumultuous relationship</a>. “Jake, kindly go to the court on Tuesday and take custody your brother from [Irish Child and Family Agency] Tusla,” she wrote. “Do not abandon your brother or any other of my babies again. What you have done to your brother and your mother is LITERALLY criminal.”</p><h2><strong>Roison Waters</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sinead-O-Connor-kids-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>After Jake was born, Sinéad opened up about having an abortion in a 1991 interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Spin</a>. She admitted that the song “My Special Child” was about the experience. She admitted that even though she wanted a second child, the baby’s father seemed absent. “We were fighting. I was on tour, and I was feeling sick all the time. I didn’t know what to do, and he wasn’t really interested in the child. So I was left with the decision of whether or not to have the child, knowing that the father wasn’t going to be around,” she told&nbsp;Spin. “I decided that it was better not to and that I would have a child at a later stage when his father would be around and involved. I didn’t feel that I could handle it by myself.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>After her marriage to her first husband ended, Sinéad started seeing Irish journalist <strong>John Waters,&nbsp;</strong>and the pair had a daughter&nbsp;<strong>Roison,&nbsp;</strong>25, in March 1995. Sinéad and John had a long custody battle over their daughter, which led to the singer <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>attempting to commit suicide</a> in 1999, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Biography.</a></p><h2><strong>Shane Lunny</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sinead-O-Connor-kids-jake-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>After a brief marriage to writer&nbsp;<strong>Nick Sommerlad&nbsp;</strong>from 2001 to 2004, Sinéad had her third child Shane with Irish folk singer&nbsp;<strong>Donal Lunny</strong>.
