We knew each other six months, got engaged, we were married within a year, and then had <strong>Ella</strong> the next year. And I think for us, especially in this business, and careers, and a lot of work. Family was always a priority, but I think Ben and I both sort of started to grow in different directions.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The Zoolander beauty then described how their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>three-year separation</a> was necessary for their growth as individuals. “That time apart for each of us to sort of get to know who we are…I think we have these growth spurts even as adults,” she remarked. “And I feel like we needed just some time to figure that out.” She added that they “always stayed a family unit” with their 2 kids, daughter Ella and son <strong>Quinlin</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Christine-Taylor-Ben-Stiller-Found-Eachother-Split-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>An insider told us back in 2022 that the couple’s rekindled romance didn’t come as a shock to her friends. “<span class=markh4yv5aija data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Christine</span>’s friends <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>aren’t surprised one bit </a>that she and Ben are back together,” they told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY for a Feb. 2022 report. “Everyone was so upset when they broke up because they really did seem like the perfect couple. But <span class=markh4yv5aija data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Christine</span> and Ben have stayed very close over the past few years and have always maintained a really healthy, co-parenting relationship.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH10e49wZqGnp2Kwqb7IrKuippViwaLFy6ipZpqVo3q0wMilo56qXaeytrrIrZydZZGbwaa%2BjKynpaGkYrGmwMCio6xn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
