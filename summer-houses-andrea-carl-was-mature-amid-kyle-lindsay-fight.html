It was a fun time.”</p><p>The Italy native — who made a cameo on Monday’s episode after <a href=#>exiting the show as a full-time cast member following season 6</a> — recalled being caught off guard when during a game of “stir the pot,” <a href=#><strong>Danielle Olivera</strong></a>’s answer brought <a href=#><strong>Amanda Batula</strong></a> to tears.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Summer-House-Andrea-Denver-Carl-Radke-Was-Mature-Amid-Kyle-Cooke-Lindsay-Hubbard-Blowout-Fight.jpg><p>During the house’s sleepover, which fans saw on the season 7 episode, Danielle, 34, pointed to Amanda, 31, as the person she would “trust the least.” The Loverboy creative director was surprised to hear that and <a href=#>started to cry after the “personal” attack</a>.</p><p>“I didn’t expect Amanda to get that emotional,” Andrea told Us of the moment, revealing that the New Jersey native received a call about her and <a href=#><strong>Kyle Cooke</strong></a>’s dogs off camera that might’ve added to her stress. “She was emotional a little bit that night, so I think that caught her off guard. People [then] started screaming at each other, crying. It was a lot of things that you wouldn’t have expected 30 minutes before. <a href=#>That was so totally out of the blue</a>. I was kind of shocked.”</p><p>The model noted that “a lot of, like, big words” were thrown out amid the argument, which made him “sad” since a lot of the housemates are his close friends.</p><p>The drama that Andrea spoke of <a href=#>only grew worse when Kyle, 40, got involved</a>. After seeing his wife visibly upset, the Loverboy founder blamed <a href=#><strong>Lindsay Hubbard</strong></a> for instigating the situation. During the episode he referred to Danielle as Lindsay’s “mouthpiece” and warned the publicist’s then-boyfriend, <a href=#><strong>Carl Radke</strong></a>, to “be careful what you’re dealing with here.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Amanda-Batula-Summer-House.jpg><p>“I understand Kyle stepping up for his wife. I think it’s right to do always for your loved ones,” Andrea told Us, noting, “I think there’s [different] ways to do it. <a href=#>I think maybe a different approach would’ve been better</a>, but I guess you can’t control emotion. Everybody has different emotions.”</p><p>When it came to how Carl, 38, handled the fight, Andrea commended <a href=#>the Pittsburgh native</a> for sitting on the couch and not saying anything to Kyle as he yelled at Lindsay, 36, for her alleged mean girl tactics.</p><p>“I just think <a href=#>Carl knows Kyle enough to understand that Kyle</a>, in that moment, was really over the top because [he] was pretty drunk. We had a great day until that moment, and I think he wanted to deal with it in a more prudent way,” <a href=#>the Winter House alum</a> explained. “He could have said something, but at the same time, I think in his own way [he had] a mature approach to the situation.”</p><p>Andrea added that Carl and Lindsay, who got engaged in August 2022, dealt with the drama among themselves “right away” and didn’t let Kyle’s rant affect them as a couple. “I don’t think Lindsay got that offended from Carl’s behavior. They understand each other,” he told Us, pointing out that Carl <a href=#>“loves Kyle and I think he’s upset [over] fights between” Kyle and Lindsay</a>.</p><p>Despite the onscreen drama, <a href=#>Andrea told Us he’s hopeful that Kyle and Carl will make amends</a> — with or without Lindsay and Amanda being on good terms. “I think their friendship is stronger than anything else,” he concluded. “I think they can work it together and I think there’s room for their friendship to resume and go back to the old days.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Summer House airs on Bravo Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqupZ2av260zq6qnqtdlrulvsSaZJyZoqF6uK3SZqSarKWnsm6tzKKbZqOpobJuuMinm6yZqWKzqrPHrWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
