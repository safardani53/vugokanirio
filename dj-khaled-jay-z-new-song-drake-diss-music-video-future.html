Drake has had beef with a lot of rappers lately, dissing Kanye West and Meek Mill in the past few months, but we didn’t see this diss coming! After DJ Khaled released the video for his new song “I Got The Keys” after the BET Awards on June 26, fans rushed to twitter to talk about what they thought was a diss toward Drake. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO.&nbsp;</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>A line in Drake’s song “Summer Sixteen” said “I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay<br>Now I got a house in LA, Now I got a bigger pool than Ye.” Some fans are saying this line is a response: “In real <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>life they like me</a>? In real life <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>I’m like no</a>.” He followed that up saying “Til you own your own you can’t be free,&nbsp;‘Til you’re on your own you can’t be me.” What’s interesting is that DJ Khaled JUST put out a new song with Drake called “For Free” last week. Odd that he would be part of a major diss now (if that’s what this is.)</p><h3><a href=#>Drake: See More Pics Of The Sexy Rapper</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>Check out the lyrics and tell us what you think:</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>[Intro]<br>DJ Khaled: We The Best music!<br>Jay Z: Oh this what we doin’ here<br>DJ Khaled: Another one!!!<br>Jay Z: I’ma have to put my jewelry on for this one<br>Future: Wraith talk, Wraith talk, oh we talkin’ that Wraith talk<br>Safe talk safe talk here we go talkin’ that safe talk<br>DJ Khaled: Major key alert!<br>Jay Z: Oh we good now<br>Future: Major bag alert<br>DJ Khaled: DJ Khaled!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>[Hook: Future]<br>I got them keys, keys, keys<br>I got them keys, keys, keys<br>I got them keys, keys, keys<br>I got them keys, keys, keys<br>We go to court, we gon’ plead the fifth<br>I know the judge, I’ma shoot him some chips<br>I got them keys, keys, keys<br>I got them keys, keys, keys</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>[Verse 1: Jay Z]<br>Niggas always asking me the key<br>‘Til you own your own you can’t be free<br>‘Til you’re on your own you can’t be me<br>How we still slaves in 2016?<br>Key to life, keep a bag comin’<br>Every night another bag comin’<br>I ain’t been asleep since ’96<br>I ain’t seen the back of my eyelids<br>I been speedin’ through life with no safety belt<br>One on one with the corner with no safety help<br>I perform like Josh Norman, I ain’t normal, n*gga<br>Just a project n*gga out in Beverly Hills, California n*gga<br>That Wraith talk, that’s foreign n*gga<br>Special cloth talk here<br>All my niggas from the mud damn near<br>All my n*ggas millionares<br>We gon’ take it there I swear<br>You gon’ think a n*gga’s psychic<br>You ain’t seen nothin’ like this<br>I should probably copyright this<br>I promise they ain’t gonna like this</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>[Hook: Future]<br>I got them keys, keys, keys<br>I got them keys, keys, keys<br>I got them keys, keys, keys<br>I got them keys, keys, keys<br>We go to court, we gon’ plead the fifth<br>I know the judge, I’ma shoot him some chips<br>I got them keys, keys, keys<br>I got them keys, keys, keys<br>Radar, radar on, these n*ggas ain’t even on my radar<br>Radar, radar on, on, you ain’t on my radar<br>Radar, radar, no, no, you hatin’ on my radar<br>No, no, you bitches ain’t, b*tches ain’t even on my radar</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>[Verse 2: Jay Z]<br>I got a bag for lawyers, like f*ck ya charges<br>Hop out the courtroom like, “What charges?”<br>Big pimpin’ on your court steps<br>Case y’all ain’t notice, I ain’t lost yet<br>Y’all know it’s one to one<br>Soon as you hear that uh, uh, uh<br>Y’all know the difference right<br>From rap facts and fiction right?<br>Real life I’m like HOV<br>Real life I’m life goals<br>In real life they’re like me?<br>In real life I’m like no<br>My swag different, that bag different<br>My wife Beyoncé, I brag different<br>My baby Blue<br>(What else?)<br>I dream in color<br>(What else?)<br>That’s too much flavor<br>I don’t rap to suckas<br>(Ha!)<br>God bless you all<br>I only talk special talk<br>I only talk special cloth<br>Said I only talk special, ah!</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>[Hook: Future]<br>I got them keys, keys, keys<br>I got them keys, keys, keys<br>I got them keys, keys, keys<br>I got them keys, keys, keys<br>We go to court, we gon’ plead the fifth<br>I know the judge, I’ma shoot him some chips<br>I got them keys, keys, keys<br>I got them keys, keys, keys<br>Radar, radar on, these n*ggas ain’t even on my radar<br>Radar, radar on, on, you ain’t on my radar<br>Radar, radar, no, no, you hatin’ on my radar<br>No, no, you b*tches ain’t, b*tches ain’t even on my radar</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>[Interlude]<br>DJ Khaled: I got the keys<br>Future: I got the keys, keys, keys<br>DJ Khaled: I got the keys to all success!<br>Future: I got the keys, keys, keys<br>DJ Khaled: We the best!<br>Future: I got the keys, keys, keys<br>DJ Khaled: Roc Nation!
