Philadelphia Eagles tight end Zach Ertz proposed to his love, soccer star Julie Johnston, over the weekend.
The couple, who met at a baseball game at Ertz’s alma mater, Stanford University, headed back to Klein Field at Sunken Diamond in Stanford, California, this weekend, where the football player — who recently signed a $43.5 million contract with the Eagles — got down on one knee. The stadium had clearly been done up for 23-year-old Johnston, as a banner in the background read “Congratulations Zach & Julie” with a festive fireworks background."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I get to spend forever with my best friend. The best day of my life!” Johnston, who is currently training for the 2016 Rio Olympics, captioned an Instagram photo of herself showing off her round-cut ring while kissing her beau’s cheek.</p><p>Her 25-year-old fiancé also posted on the social media site, with a photo of the NFL star on one knee and a clearly surprised Johnston.</p><p>“She said yes!! My best friend made this the best day of my life! #MrsErtz,” he wrote of the photo of himself on bended knee as Johnston reacted in surprise.</p><p>It’s been an exciting month for the World Cup champ. On February 19, the Women’s National Soccer team defeated Trinidad and Tobago at BBVA Compass Stadium in Houston, Texas, to qualify them for the Olympics. The team will defend their World Cup title in Rio and hopes to become the first FIFA women’s team to win the World Cup followed immediately by an Olympic gold medal.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>But before Rio, Johnston will be busy with wedding planning! “I’m starting to plan now,” she exclusively tells <i>Us Weekly</i>. “It seems so far away, but with the Olympics this summer and then Zach’s season in the fall, it’s going to be here before we know it! The hardest part is our schedules are so busy that there won’t be a lot of dates that work. I’m on the road a lot right now, so I have lots of time to look at things on long travel days and after training. It actually really helps make the long travel days go faster. I have so many ideas, so we’re just figuring out exactly we want.”</p><p>To learn more about all the Olympic hopefuls, visit <a href=#>TeamUSA.org</a>.
